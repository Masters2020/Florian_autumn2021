"do we have enough left for tomorrow we don't have tomorrow good Ben Shapiro we are live the people have spoken well thank you for having me thanks for being here man I became a fan of yours when I watched you with what the fuck is his name the CNN Piers Morgan oh that was glorious when you went after him dissent with the Sandy Hook thing like right away immediately like it was just glorious and you could tell that he didn't know what to do with it and he literally said how dare you which is what I say with to people all the time when I'm joking yes thank you was clutching his pearls he he was really pissed he was it was a two segment interview and during the break I said to him thanks so much for having me on it kind of growled at me he was not a happy camper yeah well you crushed him and the other one of my other favorite ones was Chelsea Handler crushing him or she was literally talking like you don't even talk to me in the brake and the brake you're checking your phone and checking Twitter and you could tell he was like oh no he just you know he came from that weird British tabloid environment and you found out that the company that he worked for did really creepy shit like check people's voicemails they hacked into people's people who are dead and they gave the family false hope because they had checked the voicemail and they found out that someone checked in they thought oh maybe she's still alive and then we made him a host unlike the x-factor and brought him on Sienna is awesome I just decision all around why CNN thought that we have this fascination with British people yes if you have a British accent we automatically had 20 points to IQ yeah they're great for like selling mops late night and nonstick cookware and I enjoyed John Oliver I think John Oliver is great apparently he has you know a lot of people think of all British accents as being the same but he has like blue collar British accent but I don't I can't tell the difference too much except when I'm watching my fair lady or something well I could tell people from like Manchester and stuff like that because they you know they they have like this sort of like way of talking so fast that all the words kind of pile into each other but uh yeah Oliver's his his recent one any Bravo got really matter the recent one about Alex Jones is fucking hilarious well you see it's almost impossible to make something not funny about Alex Jones yeah you gotta meet Alex have you met him I don't know that given how much I've made fun of him strip off his shirt and start he might calm down you're a good guy we're basically on the same team come around if you remember the Piers Morgan thing happened two nights after Alex was on Piers Morgan so element so appears was like flying high because he had that whole debate with Alex and Alex did his schtick and it was really over the top and he thought I was gonna be like Alex Jones par tunas gonna be peers you know succeeds again and Alex and I could not be more different than richest no you're very rational and very reasonable and you know we've been talking about some of your debates there's not a lot of guys like you out there which is really interesting it's like you're a fast thinking fast talking very smart young guy who's also a conservative like there's not a lot of those out there and this is one of the things that we're encountering today is they're especially on college campuses there's this very strange separation between the left and the right to the point where the right is like almost non-existent or at least doesn't have any representation and they're actively shunning that representation like they're pushing people out I know what's going on with you and Berkeley has been resolved yeah I think that so Berkeley after the publicity they said they're gonna explain to people if they don't know the whole story yes so UC Berkeley if you recall last year I actually spoke there before any of this happened I spoke at UC Berkeley in like April 2016 and then Milo was supposed to speak there and he actually went there and there was a riot where an Tifa infiltrated the the student community and there are all these pictures of them bombing things and you know blowing up cars and under setting them to fire at least and throwing things at windows and so Berkeley shut down that event for safety reasons then Ann Coulter wanted to speak there and they basically used what they call time place and manner restrictions to stop her they kept saying we have safety problems we can't figure out how to do the events and in the end they just canceled that because they didn't have security and then young America's Foundation which sponsors me to go to a lot of these campuses they said we want Shapiro to come and again I spoke there like a year and a half ago and they give them two and a half months advance and Berkeley said well we have no venues available and so this seemed to be another cover for we're not going to allow a conservative on campus because there are security problems so we made that public and then Berkeley said no no well we'll make we'll make sure that you get in they give us an alternative venue and so they even said they'd cover the security they didn't like the bad publicity oh well that's nice yes that should be good well you know what happened with Jordan Peterson yesterday yes yeah just yesterday Jordan Peterson was banned from YouTube and YouTube has a new policy that uh it's very it's very weirdly worded but apparently they're allowed to block and restrict any kind of videos that are about religion or that could be deemed offensive which is almost everything yeah that's right anything that's remotely if I mean anything that's interesting is going to be offensive to somebody so it won't be monetized it also won't be in the emoto's of interest or I know they did this to Prager University as well they blocked like ten of their videos a couple of months ago so it's it's yeah I mean this is nasty stuff and listen YouTube's a private company they have the right to do what they want but don't proclaim that you're a free speech promoting institution if you're gonna block people like Jordan Peterson for God's sake well the problem is they're not blocking things that are offensive to other people they're not blocking certain things that are representing Islam in a positive light that's right there's there's a lot of weirdness with this left-wing choice of what to censor and what not to censor and it's it's not just dangerous it's also bad for the whole idea of being a progressive or being a liberal because it makes you look it makes them look really petty and really weird and really resistant and hesitant to actually have real debate yeah for sure I mean this is one of the reasons why I'm very meticulous in my terminology about people who are on the other side of the aisle actually separate people who are liberal from people who are leftist so when they're people who try to ban speech I call them leftist and if they are not interested in banning speech then their liberal meaning they they want bigger government they disagree with me on politics but they're still willing to have a conversation they want an open forum people who are on the hard left think that it's actually an insult to their identity to disagree with them and this is what I experience sometimes on campuses you know at Cal State LA where there's a near riot when I speak or University of Wisconsin where people storm the stage and stand in front of it and won't leave Penn State we have again another near violence incident over at Penn State or DePaul where they actually banned me outright so sometimes you get this routine from people who think that they conflate their viewpoint with their identity and then if you have a different viewpoint you're denying them their humanity and it's like no I'm not denying you I just think what you're saying is dumb like that's a very good point that's a very good point is that they have their identity completely connected with their ideology and when you oppose these people when you have these debates of these people what's really fascinating is the level of a stereo that gets reached while you're staying calm yeah that's what I've noticed is is that there's a ton of you know I tend to keep relatively calm just as a human being and very often when I'm debating someone you see them getting more and more and more emotional and people on the right love this because of course it's the triggering of the snowflakes but the easiest thing in the world to do is trigger some idiot college kid who doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground and what's what's hard to do is actually discuss issues with somebody who's intelligent enough to make the to make the point but it's it that the level of hysteria on the campuses has really increased I mean I don't have to travel with two members of security to every campus just because you don't know which campus is gonna go off I never had to travel a security before it's the weirdest thing in the world how long did this start happening well February of 2016 is when I started traveling with security so I spoke at University of Missouri they remember they had a big blowup at University of Missouri with black lives matter taking over campus offices and suggesting there's some sort of big racism problem at Mizzou which is just ridiculous and so they flew me and I did a speech there and then the next time I spoke was Cal State LA and they brought in a couple of security guys and I was like what do I need security for man I'm just speaking on a campus who cares we get to the campus and they had already tried to cancel my speech because of security and I said I'm coming anyway so tough I had to be escorted in by 20 armed police officers I had to be escorted off campus by motorcycle cops flashing their lights there were 300 students who had blocked all of the entrances were physically assaulting people trying to get into the theater the police had to sneak the students in two-by-two into the theater they told them that until I left the campus they couldn't actually let the kids out of the theater because they were afraid that if they let the kids out of the theater they'd be attacked as they got as they were released it was that one was pretty wild so after that it was like okay well I guess the security is necessary what is shifting like what what is what is ramping I think the identity politics is ramping things up so I think there's a new mentality out there it's the this intersectionality politics on the left that says that they're a bunch of victim groups basically are their blacks and Hispanics and gays and Jews and Asians they're all victim groups and we get those all those people together to attack the system because the system is keeping them down and if you and there's a hierarchy among these victim groups and if you are a straight white male you're at the very very bottom of the hierarchy in terms of viewpoints that should be acknowledged because you're the creators of this vast white supremacist system that keeps down everybody else if you're a black woman you're near the top right if you're LGBT you're at the top if you're a white guy and you challenge the viewpoint of a black woman your viewpoint is an attack on her identity and therefore she has the right to shut you down and so the idea is that your words are violence to her identity and therefore she has the right to react this is the term you hear on campus a lot is microaggressions this idea that my opinion micro aggresses you now even that terminology I think is really stupid because normally in regular life we would say that's insulting and you said something I don't like the terminology microaggressions suggests aggression like I'm actually doing something aggressive to you and the rational response to someone aggressing you is to use physical force in response and so you saw you start to see a more violent response I think that's it's been growing in our politics I think there's a reactionary side on the right that's that's growing and if there's an identity politics on the left that says no black eyed any politics gay identity politics female identity politics I think you're starting to see in some areas of white identity politics that's almost formed in response like okay well if everybody else gets to have their identity politics why can't we defend ourselves on those same grounds I hate that shit I hate that shit too and I would like to find the person who invented the term microaggression that fucker whoever it was they they created quite a mess now I'm sure you saw what happened in Evergreen with Brett Weinstein where literally the left is eating itself and that's where it gets crazy is like you're not progressive enough unless you're literally submitting to leaving your class because you're white like you can't be there because you're white they want a day of absence meaning the professor's the white people and then when you don't do it you're somehow another racist and a Nazi I mean the whole thing is the whole thing was very bizarre to watch but but not sure not surprising because you see it so much so often all over the country right now and it's almost like some new flower of ridiculous thinking and behavior yet has blossomed and it's in bloom everywhere and when people could point to it existing in other places like in Missouri with that woman that was your name Crick was that woman who click yeah yeah whatever her name was yeah but when you see it in video when you see her on video saying can we get some muscle over here exactly like this is fucking insane like you're telling a photographer and by the way a minority an asian asian man taking photos of a public place that you've created some safe space but it's it's it's this weird thing where it's half of it as identity politics but it's also wrapped up in this need to control people and control people's behavior control their vernacular control the way they communicate and how you know how much you give in to groupthink it's it's weird it's it's scary and a Jonathan Hyde is a social psychologist over done why you hit a really good piece for the Atlantic in 2015 about this phenomenon this kind of safe space trigger warning phenomena on this idea that you must never be forced into a position where someone has an idea that opposes yours and what he said is it basically makes people crazy you know it actually makes you crazy that the idea in psychology is that if you have a chain of thoughts leading to a bad outcome if you're depressed or if you're depressive then you have a chain of thoughts leading to a bad outcome the way that psychologists deal with that is with cognitive behavioral therapy they say ok we're in this chain of thoughts are you going wrong are you attributing to somebody a motive they don't have right is your wife really being nasty or is it you just attributing nasty to her and that's why you're getting depressed you're spinning off right try to control your own train of thoughts what the microaggression trigger warning culture does is it actually grants lay out the more you are offended the more value you are granted and therefore you have actually an interest in being offended we give you awards if you're offended right you're you're treasured if you're offended because it demonstrates that you're woke right you're well the more you are offended the more we can show that you are woke and because you are woke therefore you're granted this virtue you get to lord it over everyone else I mean I say in my speeches if we could somehow identify like the LGBTQ half black half Hispanic 1/4 Native American little person you know then we would finally have the the person who we could go to to answer all of our questions because their identity would be unquestionable biota right if we could find Yoda we could just get rid of democracy in discussion all together he just rule from on high he she I don't want to put a gender on Yoda right I don't think yo does Genoa gotta be a guy deep voice maybe we're being rude but inside no but yeah you're absolutely right is no one is uh no one's left enough yeah it's it's I don't know where the limit is and it's they're so far left that they've actually made come and cross with the people they hate right so then they talk about safe spaces and say it yet Missouri yet all these black students protesting and they actually said we don't want white people who think like us and who want to help us in our safe spaces we feel insulted by that I just thought to myself oh the KKK agrees like if you want to do safe spaces for separate races I can find some Jim Crow racists are totally up for that from like 1962 well there's the the really bizarre statement that I've heard over and over again that black people cannot be racist against white people because they don't have any power over white people yes Wow which is just it's inane I mean it's in the naiton statement this idea that you have to you have to have power in the superstructure in order for you to even to be erased I can understand the argument if they said look you being racist is not connected to racist action if you don't have the capacity for action that affects people then your personal racism is not as important as the racism of people in power then at least is an argument right the idea that you can't be racist at all if you're if you're black because black people don't have enough power first of all the idea that black people have no power in the United States is utterly crazy I mean it's utterly crazy well especially when I was going on more well Obama was president the Attorney General was was president yeah we said this about Baltimore we kept hearing you Baltimore right were they the riots they but with a dry 'its and they were saying well Baltimore PD you know they're they're cracking down on black people okay the chief of police was black the majority of the City Council was black and Democrat the entire day the the deputy the district attorney was prosecuting the case was black the majority of the police department was minority the Attorney General of the United States was black the President of the United States was black but up here in the majority of the city of Baltimore is black but apparently it's the white guy's fault like I just at some point you're gonna have to make your ideas actually work in concert with reality okay I can't like do this with you do you ever step back and look at this trend and look at what's going on in popular culture and looking what's going on with identity politics in this war between the left and the right and wonder where it's going I mean how it feels like the people on the left are completely emboldened by the fact that you have this guy in office who has said things like grab him by the pussy and he lies all the time and makes fun of people's plastic surgery and you you think that having this guy in in this position I guess in some way emboldened them and makes them even more convinced the fact they're right you know fight but put up the resistance and the huge tag resistance hashtag resist it's all over the place where does this go I think well no place good I think what's happening and it's one of the things that I personally am not a fan of and this goes all the way back to the Piers Morgan debate that you mentioned I mean I started off that debate with Piers Morgan saying to him you don't get to in tribute intent to me that I don't have right right you're standing on the graves of the kids of Sandy Hook in order to promote your political agenda implying I don't care enough about dead kids because I don't agree with you that is the sweet spot where a lot of people like to live which is if we disagree on politics it's because you're an asshole right it's not it's not because we disagree on the best method to get to the goal or we have different goals is because you're a bad person and I think that what you're seeing is with Trump there's an attempt to cast all of his voters as people who love all of the things that are bad that he does and says it's not that they voted for him because they thought Hillary Clinton was the worst presidential candidate in the history of America which is true right it's they they voted for him because they liked to grab him by the p-word stuff right they voted for him because they like that he's vulgar and he lies a lot they voted for him because they are bad people right there this is why people misread I think Hillary Clinton's deplorable speech and the implication was okay everybody who voted for Trump is a bad human being they tried this with Romney too I mean they tried to cast to get Romney who's whatever you can say about Mitt Romney Mitt Romney was maybe the most honorable person ever to run for the presidency they tried to cast him as Jill Biden said a guy who wants to put y'all back in Chains and he said that he he straps dogs to the top of his car is an evil man Stieg i oh yeah this was a big issue as dogs so there was there was a there's a story and he was in the Boston Globe about how like back in 1982 he went on a family vacation and when they're traveling he put the dog in a cage and put the dog on the top of his car and this is and this was like a big campaign issue right remember binders full of women and you remember in the 47% number exactly he's mean he hates the poor he hates what the binders full of women thing was particularly stupid because the entire point he was making is that I was trying to recruit women to my administrations they bring binders full of female resumes to me right so I could staff more women and they turned it into binders full of woman he's like Hugh Hefner yeah Mitt Romney like really so this attempt to castigate the other side is really bad and I think that you see some of that on the right but I think it's more reactionary I think that the unearned moral superiority that the left likes to kind of wallow in I think that's that's more on the left and on the right although I think that there is an attempt by some on the right now in response to do some of that well it becomes these sticking points that you use to win you know and it becomes something that people repeat over and over again you know like the deplorable thing racist sexist bigoted homophobe yeah it's just I was walking down New York City down the street right after Trump won when they were protesting and there was this guy right next to me fucking screaming he wasn't even in the actual parade itself he was like on the sidewalk but he was screaming Donald Trump KKK racist sexist anti-gay yeah ed just boiled it down to this thing but the best part about it was he saw a black guy coming towards him and he just started screaming black lives matter I just I just I saw him I saw his soul like in that one move exact shift to screaming black lives matter when he saw a black guy yeah there's the intersectionality for you right you know you have to know how to appeal to every racial group on the basis of a stereotype it could've been Thomas Sowell they wouldn't have known yeah it's almost like the the laziness in having the ability to communicate is one thing but having the ability to express a complete thought that covers something as nuanced in this complex as American politics in 2017 that's too hard so let's just yell out Donald Trump okay and this this ability to like boil down what's the difference between the left and the right to like a little statement is or you know a bucket of deplorable basket of deplorable whatever it is you know but binders of women it's so tempting cuz it's like it's so powerful that it works you put it on the back of a bumper sticker and I think we've also been shaped a little bit by a look we all we all live in Hollywood I mean you live in Hollywood I live in Hollywood that means that and I think all of America lives in that milieu because everyone watches TV everybody watches movies so when we do politics we tend to see it through the prism of house of cards or any of the other political movies you've ever seen and that means there's a bad guy right everybody there's a bad guy there's a villain and the villain house it can't just be the de villain is somebody who's incompetent like usually in politics if somebody is bad sometimes they have a malevolent point of view that's pretty rare usually it's somebody who's misguided they have some bad ideas usually they're just stupid or incompetent like this is what I keep saying to people who oppose Trump like why are you attributing to him malice when stupidity would do well you keep saying that everything Trump is doing is out of some sort of malicious genius are we watching the same film like if you have a problem with Trump it seems I have a solution for the left by the way if they if they really hate Trump this much listen I thought Obama was a crappy president I have a deal how about we just minimized the power of Washington DC and then we don't have to give a crap who's the President of the United States you think anybody in 1832 really cared who the president was he had no impact on their lives but now the presidency has this outsized impact we care about Washington all the time we treated that mean the truth as we watch it for fun I mean right now the last week particularly with Skinner Moochie you know it's impossible not to watch it for fun but it's actually kind of serious business like there are other world leaders who are actually looking at this like this impacts my nation for us we look at it we go well I wonder what's on TV on tonight's episode of Trump the series when you say reduce the power of the president I think there's a lot of people that would think that would be a great idea because having one person has the authority over 300 plus million people it is kind of ridiculous at this point time but how would you go about doing that like what would be the best way to implement something like that I mean it really isn't just the presidency you'd have to reduce the power of Congress as well I mean you have to you have to go back to a federalist based system where localities and states have more power over over local issues and the federal government isn't that powerful because what's happened basically in the concert to tional structure the federal government was never supposed to be anywhere near the speck right that there are very certain delegated powers in the Constitution of the United States that Congress has and they are very small I mean it's things like building post offices and interstate roads and regulating interstate commerce but the idea that they could regulate you know your toilet flushing is just that that's silly I mean the founders would have thought that was ridiculous yet you have a federal government that that's that's that big so Congress regulates on that but if you're in Congress the last thing you want is to be answerable for that so what you do instead is you drop vague statutes right you say things like we hope but we're passing a law that says that we should fix the environment and then you kick it over to the executive branch and the executive branch you know run by President Trump or President Obama has a bunch of executive branch agencies like the EPA and the APA puts together all these regulations that you've never seen never heard of you never elected these people they put together all the regulations and then those are the ones that actually govern your lives so if you're in Congress and things go bad you say well that's not what I meant to do I told them do good stuff and the bureaucrats were not elected don't have to care so basically we have everyone kicking the they can to the other person for purposes of responsibility the only way this is going to happen is if the American people just decide they're sick of the federal government running all this stuff and they start actively working to elect people who want to minimize their own power which is difficult I mean most people in power don't want to minimize their own power yeah that seems almost impossible it seems like no one who's worked so hard to get to the top of the game he's gone truck the other way to do it is to elect people on the state level who are pretty zealous about their own authority right you've seen this from like Greg Abbott in Texas that every so often he'll say to the federal government listen you're telling me to do something go screw yourselves like what are you gonna do about it well Texas is a weird one like they're almost ready to leave yeah at any point ready to put a fence up and go fuck you I mean weren't they for the longest time they were they were not really a state right yeah they're still called the republic of Genesis right yeah I mean people in Texas I mean it it's a wonderful state I love that when you drive through Texas every single store is called Lone Star yeah you know Lone Star brewery or Texas this everything is named after the state like nothing is really named after the country it's all named after the state like a lot of state pride in Texas there's a lot of State pride maybe more than any place else I've ever been yeah well not a lot of state pride in California because everybody's a transplant and yeah it's um you know people who get here and it represents something that they always wanted you know some sort of a liberal paradise where you could get famous for doing nothing there's some city pride like there's how enterprise or San Jose pride but like California pregnant on the state are idiots well California is so confused I mean we have a grizzly bear on our flag but we don't have crizzley bears we have we have a team called the Los Angeles Lakers not awaken them our legs are all man-made we have to keep pumping water in because they fucking dry up a river is just a giant concrete yeah Raveena yeah is hilarious when when I've shown people the LA River my tester LA River they like shut up yeah the LA River like it just it is la it's a fucking concrete shitty slide for water the city is so dirty I mean it's it's like I've grown up my entire life here I mean I was born in Burbank grew up in North Hollywood like this is the Evolet of my entire life the first time I realized I liked it is when I moved to Boston for law school because at least the weather here is good yeah but yeah I mean it's gotten so shabby lately it's such a shabby city the weather is amazing but have you ever been to Mexico City no I've been a couple times for UFC events I'm not going back because I would get headaches from the pollution and them and what Mexico City to me is is like LA in the future but with zero respect for the traffic lights what I mean zero I've never seen anything like it it's crazy they're very nice people everybody's worried about getting kidnapped over there I find Mexican people to be some of the nicest people and real friendly and easy to get along with but they don't give a fuck about traffic lights when we were stuck in traffic look there's bumper-to-bumper and two green like going this way cars just go in front of you and they just sort of make their way through and people hit the brakes and they make their way through the intersection it's a straight up red light and they just go and it's not just one one guy goes and another guy goes behind them and then you got like 20 cars and and it's just gridlock yes but it's actually indicative of why the United States works that people actually follow traffic it's like it's true in Italy also it's true in Israel like when I visited Israel with my wife when we got married like no one pays attention to the traffic rules everyone's honking their horns at each other I'm American so why are these people so rude all the time that's like honk the horn she's really but it is why in America because we have a baseline and this is what I think is breaking down actually so not to get too deep on a point about Mexican city traffic but I think that you know the country was based on this idea there's a social fabric we all have respect for each other enough that we're gonna follow the basic rules of the game and that's true as far as traffic lights it's true as far as financial dealings with one another and when you lose that when you lose the basic respect for the guy who lives next to you you know you need to get through the red light you know screw him it doesn't matter if it's red then it's kind of indicative of a culture in collapse generally when small rules start to go broken like in Italy the problem in Italy is that 50% of their economy is black market because they have high tax rates and no one pays them you're starting to that in California too California is the highest taxes in the country by far we also have the number-one rate of deductions so we pass all these high taxes so we can you know congratulate ourselves for social justice and then we avoid all the taxes as much as we possibly can to want to pull for the accountants yeah exactly those people are making a freaking fortune well I just also feel like when you get a giant number of people smashed into a small area and with la it's not even a small area it includes Greater Orange County and it goes into the Conejo Valley and it's just like there's so many of us there's so again it's it's almost like you get that sort of diffusion of responsibility thing where there's just too many people to care about and you lose this feeling of value that you have for fellow people I lived in Boulder for a little while and when I lived there the People's Republic of Boulder you want to talk about lefties oh yeah holy shit if you have a if you had a right wing anything on your lawn like a sign for someone running for they would take it down they literally take things down but when I was there I was amazing how many people are polite when they drive and they wave and like there's only a hundred thousand people exactly so that I was gonna say I'm looking it up while we're sitting here it's like 110,000 people in there and the population of LA County is 10 million people it's it's plus Mexicans you gotta count Mexicans and then you gotta count everybody's - connected to all the other counties around it's not like there's some border yeah let's drive around that's exactly right so it's it is the first time I visited Oklahoma I had this you know I was in Oklahoma for doing a radio show California will be about twenty three point seven seven million yeah sorry go away yeah I'm in Oklahoma and I'm walking down the street and the first thing that and and just some lady and I catch eyes now in LA you're from LA you look away right you're only gonna stabbed you know that if you catch eyes with somebody you meet it's rude you don't catch eyes with people in LA and among the street we catch eyes that he goes how are you I called my father I was like what the where am i what's going on here like this is not regular but I do think that there is something to the idea that if you have too many people in too small of space well we're all up in each other's business so much that it's very hard to say to people okay Liberty stay away from one another leave each other alone it's like yeah but he lives next door and he's a jackass hate that guy cuz he's like right next to you run Oklahoma the guy next to yous three miles down the hook there's that and there's also it's been replicated in rat population density studies that you get more mental illness you get more weird aggressive behavior when they stack rats and these cubicles and then just jam them closer and closer together and that's exactly what's happening with people to what Manhattan is famous for it I mean I I enjoy visiting Manhattan and every time I'm there I'm always like no I can't I can't right here oh yes too many humans there last week and I like the sky so you can't actually see the sky in Manhattan right I mean you see the brick buildings and you know 25 stories high and I noticed that we were walking back to past a store and there was a shirt on sale and the shirts entire text was fu you effing eff and I thought only in New York could you sell this right I mean try to take this anywhere else and people would've been like wait what now but in New York I'm sure that's a best-seller that's why honestly I think it's one of the reasons why Trump won is because he's basically just a guy from New York he's like a taxi driver from New York who's really really wealthy and you know he does what a taxi driver from New York would do if you're really really wealthy he marries models and builds gold toilets and all this kind of stuff and people in the rest of the country actually take that language seriously so when he says stuff like yeah we're gonna bomb the shit out of him you know people in New York like he has so he do you know and people in Oklahoma like wow he's serious it's actually gonna happen and I think probably not probably this just have people from kind of talked we saw this last week right he's talking about the cops and he was saying this thing at hover in her hands he's talking like a Long Island or you know he's talking about like you know the they throw in the back of the paddy wagon and we do all the in and you don't put your head on that it's fine he they bump their head they just Mick Holtzman and so the entire meeting wouldn't know how dare he he's talking about how cops should rough people up listen is it appropriate for the President of the United States to talk like that about treatment of suspects no is are we supposed take this super seriously like this is like Trump is actually recommending a policy change with linearity in the room hey that's what he does he works the room he's a he's a New York real estate guy who works the room and more than anything else if you understand New York and you understand LA you understand Trump he's not a giant mystery right he's just any other reality TV star he's a reality he's a marketing image guy I mean that's what he does like he's not even that great at real estate he puts his name on the site he brands himself he puts his name on the side of buildings they pay him not to be involved in the real estate business so they can put Trump on the side of his hotels great I mean that's what he does that's why I'm kind of shocked that he's kind of crappy at the imaging as far as being a president you'd imagine that he'd be better at this part of it at least I just think he didn't understand the volume of hate that was gonna come his way and I think he's such an egomaniac he has a hard time dealing with it like separating and that's one of the things that I've read about him that he's getting better at getting away from the comments and not reading comments on Twitter but he fucking blocks people yes yes may suit him yeah well there's people a group of people suing them and now they're actually starting to rule against public officials people who are in the public light being able to block citizens that in having their own opinion about what this person doing or not doing so then you have to say well are you allowed to be vulgar towards the president I mean how far does that go I mean what are you allowed to say I mean maybe you should be able to a whatever the hell you want about anybody but it chance threatened I'm late but it's it does go more to the the level of pettiness he's the most powerful man on the planet when I was busy blocking people on Twitter at 3 o'clock in the morning well ghetto Scarborough and what is her name Mika Brzezinski that was just what he says name he was saying that she should this is the fucking president he's saying she showed up with bloody scar she was bleeding from her recent facelift exactly and it's it first of all it turns out that it probably wasn't true but second it wasn't true I mean it fuck goes out when you're bleeding it I agree with you I agree with you but it's it and and but this ever piece about a National Review about this you know you say that the level of hatred directed toward Trump is warping Trump I think that it's also warping some people on my side of the aisle who are who are so you know interested in the fight that they're less interested in advancing the policies that I'd like to see achieve so I think there's a whole group of people where let's say that Trump would just resign tomorrow he'd say you know what I've had it screw it I'm out and Mike Pence becomes president and then Mike Pence proceeds to do all the things conservatives want him to do you know you get tax reform and we limit immigration and we do all of these things but but he does not tweet about Mika Brzezinski bloody face I think there's a whole group of people on there I'd be pissed they'd miss it yeah I think that right I think listening now cuz it's fun what exactly what they want is somebody who pisses off the left more than beats the left right this is them off if you piss off the left I think Obama sort of trolled some of the right into insanity I think there are a lot of people on our side whereas like this jerk he just he keeps saying things just to piss us off and Obama did do some of that and so Trump is kind of a Twitter troll and so he does the same thing we're like yeah that's awesome like two days ago Trump or yesterday there was a report that Trump said that he thinks the White House is shabby now I can say is somebody on the conservative right my entire life if Obama said that we would not let him forget that for 1,000 years that the White House is shabby I mean it's like it's an ass move to say that the people's house is shit first of all two mansion right like in second of all this is the most iconic building on the face of the planet yeah oh it's shabby how much at what was he saying about he said he they were asked him why he that says visits his golf courses so much and he said oh because because because my golf courses are nicer because the White House is shabby and and but there are people on the right who are like fine it's funny like you know at least he's trolling the left at least it's ticking them off and say guys ticking off the left is not a substitute for defeating the left if you actually care about the feeding the left like this is one of the things that drives me nuts because my you know what my life goal has been to promulgate particular ideas not just to piss off the left but I think that in the fight there are a lot of people who have fallen into the trap of thinking these two things are identical right you pissed off the left that means you're winning there's like no pissing off the left maybe part of it but that's not how you win you wouldn't by saying things that are true and if they get pissed they get pissed well my good friend bill bird did this piece about Obama back when Obama was mocking Trump and saying the one thing that I am that you'll never be is the president United States the crowd went nuts yeah remember when he did and Obama was saying this on stage and you see Trump in the audience boiling with his you know big frog double chin you're sitting there eating it all and that fucking stuck in his craw there's there's a whole story that came out from BuzzFeed about his interaction with a guy named McKay Coppins a reporter for BuzzFeed in which McKay was basically like saying to Trump like you're a joke you're not gonna run I I think Trump ran just just because he was sick of people telling him that he wasn't gonna be President so yeah I really think that's that's half of what drives him that doesn't mean that he can't do good things I hope he does do good things he's the president I want every president to do things I like but you know he's gonna have to get it under control a little bit because I mean he was willing to keep the mooch I mean the mooch the boots was only ousted because of John Kelly and the mooches was it what did the mooch say what was his was about why would he think that he could say that once he's in the office I mean first of all I would see Ben and could even possibly do that I mean ban is not that flexible I know Steve that's not that's not something skills repertoire a giant unit but it doesn't matter just the idea that he would think I mean it's guy he must be emboldened by the fact that Trump has had so many outrageous things well I mean the reports from the New York Post that that he actually the Trump liked it that all that happened is that there was so much blowback that he had to replace Kelly you know puts Kelly in there and Kelly's like you can't do this right and Trump's like okay fine but doesn't it seem more crazy to fire a guy after ten days and it does to sit him down and say hey man don't say that again right let's move forward that's what they should have done the next day but the problem is he'd been doing it for a week at that point right he was out there like saying that Reince Priebus was leaking on the president was an enemy of the president for a week and he was saying that he was going to get him fired right and at the same time remember this is the same week that Trump himself is tweeting out that attorney General Sessions who is his most loyal supporter for a year and a half that that guy's like a traitor right and that he wishes he would go away cuz he recused himself yeah first of all Trump can fire any of these people at any time like this is very passive-aggressive a guy who made his living saying you're fired on TV it's amazing that all the people the Trump has fire had been fired actually through surrogates yeah Mike Flynn resigned James Comey was fired basically threw rod Rosenstein and sessions and then Rosenstein had to recuse himself which is how you get the special counsel and Comey found out on television on TV right here emissary to go to LA and and give him a letter and like everyone he fires has to be fired in the most roundabout I think that Trump actually this I think the dirty little secret is I'm not sure Trump actually likes firing people and I think I think he I think he kind of like toward any kind of like torturing people but I'm not sure that he actually likes firing them well maybe he doesn't like people being mad at him face-to-face I think that he wants them to love him in front of his face so like when he's not there you know he can make a phone call fire him Jetson hang up the phone you don't have to actually see the guy he wants that guy to like him yeah I don't the Comey thing was really bizarre because it was like oh you can do that like you this this guy is looking into improprieties and you can just say no you can't do that anymore you're fired you can't look into the things I've done wrong yeah it was a well the way he did it was the stupid part so I was calling for common to be fired since last year I thought the way he handle the whole Hillary thing from beginning to end was terrible and I thought that Trump should have replaced him before he became you know as basically day one here's my new cabinet call me he did a great job you know uh sure him out the door bringing somebody new he kept him around and then the first thing he said to Comey you remember was when he met him he said you're more famous than I am well when Trump says that to you it's the writing on the wall right there first of all it's not true but second of all I think maybe there was also a part of the problem was that commis a giant yes no chump come easy six eight six nine years giant dude towered over thing is such a comedy and Comey saying he was trying to hide in the curtains to avoid Trump they just see Herman Munster over there hiding in the it's now what did you join the show I mean it's it's wild if I didn't think that nuclear war was a possibility to probably join more but if I see a fucking Korean missile headed our way I'm gonna be pissed when Comey was handling the email thing what specifically did you not like about it what I thought it was was crazy was when he restarted or reopened the case because of whom having used her cleaner with wieners all that stuff is like that's not enough like that seems crazy the the deleting the emails to me seemed like I had Mike Baker on from the CIA and he said essentially anyone else would be in jail for what she did sure for sure sure well Comey that this is so he screwed it up and then he Reese crude it up so when he originally said publicly we're not gonna prosecute Hillary Clinton he was doing something he didn't have the authority to do the FBI does not decide whether to prosecute people they refer the information to the DOJ and then the DOJ decides whether to prosecute people it was attorney general Loretta Lynch's decision whether to prosecute or not the statute itself mammal lawyer the statute itself did not say do you have intent to commit espionage you have intent to to make classified secrets public or expose them to the possibility of being made public intent is not an element of the crime right if you do it it's a crime so my wife as it is a doctor and that means that she is under HIPAA requirements there's no elements under HIPAA that says that if she reveals somebody's you know proprietary medical information by accident well there's no intent so she's okay that's not part of the statute if she brings somebody's medical records out to her car and somebody steals the medical records you know she's working at the VA or something that's a crime doesn't matter if she intended to do it and just left it in her purse so Comey read the elements of intent into the crime to get Hillary off and then he said okay we're not gonna prosecute this we're gonna leave it alone he shouldn't have intervene in the first place remember he made an entire case basically for why she should be prosecuted and then at the end he goes but were you no but no we're not gonna do that he also said we're gonna keep Congress updated on any future development well you got October and there's a future development they found this laptop with all sorts of information on it with new emails from Hillary Clinton they haven't seen before and now he has an obligation to inform Congress because he told them that he would and so he screws the pooch again because he's afraid that if he doesn't reveal that information Hillary goes on to win and then it comes out there's something criminal then people are going to blame him for Hillary winning and putting a criminal in the White House Sin City - oh well I'll be fully transparent I have to honor my institution I'm gonna put this out there of course then Hillary loses and now he screwed up twice and then he gets into the White House and now he's supposed to be investigating the Trump Russia stuff at the same time so now he's investigating basically both candidates in the 2016 election he handled this the wrong way every step of the way because he was so focused on what will uphold the in the integrity of the FBI and the integrity of the investigations and the integrity of the DOJ he was less worried about okay what do I actually have to do under the law what's my obligation under the law his obligation under the law is to shut his piehole hand the information over to Lynch if Lynch wanted to kill the investigation let her do it so in a sense Trump was right and saying that he's a grandstander yeah for sure I mean I think that part was right but the problem remember was not the firing of Comey it was that two days after he fired Comey he went to Lester Holt on NBC and he said the reason I fired call me was not all the excuses I gave about the the Hillary stuff it's because of the Russia stuff I was angry about how he's handling Russia I mean that's really stupid yeah that's intensely stupid it's intensely stupid but it's also strange that it didn't go anywhere right like that was it like that that's against the law well it's so it's you know observation so obstruction looking at the statutes obstruction is a little bit more than that so you have to actually obstruct an ongoing investigation into criminal activity there's a counterintelligence investigation going on but not necessarily a criminal one so not to get too specific about it but you should get specific about it yeah I mean the obstruction laws I mean I've looked into kind of the statutes that they've used to suggest obstruction and it's not clear that there's any statute that specifically governs something like this plus it is true that Trump does have the power as the chief executive to fire as the commander-in-chief to fire the FBI director for any reason he chooses now all that said he can be impeached for any reason criminal or non criminal right impeachment is not a you don't actually have to have committed a crime to be impeached most people don't even understand when impeach means they think that some are another impeach means you kicked out of office right that's not right it is there's the house and they have to vote to impeach you and then there's the Senate they have to vote by a two-thirds majority or sixty yeah I think it's two-thirds majority to actually convict you of a set of crimes that they come up with but these are all political definitions right when it says high crimes and misdemeanors it doesn't mean they actually have to prosecute you like they would in a criminal court and you'd have to go to jail or any of that kind of stuff like they could impeach anybody at any time Clinton didn't even have to commit perjury if they didn't want if they wanted to you know impeach him they could they could have impeach every president you can impeach it's just a vote it's just a vote so all the talk about what's criminal and what's not criminal the problem for Trump there are two ways of reading Trump's behavior in the whole Russia thing right way one is he's got something to hide that's the most obvious way he's got something to hide that's why he gets her to Flynn we don't know why he got rid of Flynn he gets rid of Comey we don't really know why he got rid of Comey and then brags to the Russians that it's a pressure off him on the Russia stuff yeah so the way one is he's hiding something and now he's firing everybody who gets in the way and there's you know the chain of evidence doesn't not fit that I mean you know the people he's angry at in order are attorney General Sessions the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein the former head of the FBI James Comey the acting head of the FBI McCabe and and the special prosecutor right robert muller so those are all people involved with russia those are the only people he's really angry at so there's something to be said for the idea that maybe he's trying to hide something on the other hand we haven't actually seen any hard evidence of collusion itself so we saw an attempt to collude by Donald Trump jr. but we haven't actually seen any evidence that the Russians were providing special information to the Trump administration which was then being weaponized for use in the campaign we haven't seen any of that stuff so here's the other plausible theory and this goes to Trump's personality he's so petty and he wants to be loved so much that he is angry that people keep saying he run because he won because of the Russians and so now every time people say that he just gets pissed and he fires people so call me I mean this is totally plausible right Comey comes to him and has said privately that you are not under investigation and Trump says Tim well why don't you just say that and Comey says well I can't say that cuz if I say that I'm gonna have to update Congress if you do fall under investigation and Trump doesn't like that he wants the public to know he's free and clear she fires Comey and then he goes up public and he says I didn't like how he was handling the Russia thing I'm innocent why will these people leave me alone right so he is so there's two ways to read this either he's totally innocent but stupid or he's trying to hide something those are the only two plausible ways of reading the situation the Donald Trump jr. thing was really bizarre because he released all the emails like I just yeah it's like look I've got nothing to hide like you aren't supposed to do any of these things you're saying in these emails yes that was not a good moment for for Trump jr. do you think he got I mean and then you hear that he was coached by his dad again you know this is none of this is good stuff I think that Donald Trump jr. releasing the first of all it is imperative to note eight minutes later the New York Times released basically the email change right so he was meeting he's beating out of the gate and so he puts that out there which is a smart move I mean it would be smart if you it would be smart if he had found a way to spin it right right like have you done it if you don't this is the thing in politics now the way politics works now is your smartest move if there's dirt about you is to be the first person out the gate with it and you put a spin on it right so like Barack Obama imagine if Obama hadn't said anything in 2008 and then we found out a week before the election that he did coke in high school now a lot of people wouldn't care a lot of people would write in 2000 george w bush was hit with a DUI charge from 1973 and it probably lost him a point in the polls so what obama did is he wrote an entire memoir and he just kind of dismissed it right in the middle of the memoir he goes you know when i was in high school did a little blow no problem it'll blow everybody and everyone oh okay did a little blow alright you know cool so if you're going to release this kind of stuff you have to put a spin on it trump turn your didn't you just put out the emails and the emails themselves contain the damning material right it says right in there right you know there's a russian government lawyer the russian government sees this as part of its effort to aid mr. Trump's campaign and Donald juniors like thumbs up guys like I love it sounds awesome right and so that does not look good it's not quite as much as you know people on the Left want to say it is meaning that there's no evidence yet that any information was actually exchanged with the Russians or that anything came of the meeting most of the people in the meeting who've said something and said nothing came of it you know but we don't know whether Trump knew about the meeting I find it kind of hard to believe he didn't you know considering every major campaign figure was there but but you know then then they then they just keep lying and this is this is the part that's proud that's a problem are they lying because they just think they can get away with it and they're stupid or are they long because they're actually being meticulous about their lies yeah I tend to think the former because this isn't a professional administration I think these I think Trump you know fibs a lot he says things that I mean like on stupid things he says things like the leader of the Boy Scouts called me and told me that he loved my speech ever and then leader of the Boy Scouts like what so if so is that a calculated lie to hide something or is it just the Trump lies by nature and so he does it a lot well I think he's just so used to putting that that spin on things that publicity spin right and the thing that he said about this was that this is what politics does what happens in politics you get dirt about your enemy and people exchange information it's just what happens it's just you're seeing it now so a lot of people like yeah well that makes sense right and this is something that again I think that we're shaped by Hollywood a little bit politics is dirty but some of this stuff is not usual right it's actually not particularly usual to meet with a government that is really not friendly to the United States to receive information about your political opponents but if you've watched house of cards you think well I mean it's like two steps down from throwing somebody under the subways I don't because I work in politics when I go home at night the last thing I want to do is watch and read about politics now watch Game of Thrones that's as political as a guest yeah house of cards is a great show but if it's half right like I always wonder the thing the thing that gets me is when people suicide themselves that are on the way to trial I'm like okay I don't want to be that fucking guy I don't want to be that tinfoil hat guy but how many people are gonna suicide themselves I mean for sure someone's been murdered somewhere along the line someone knew something some powerful people got to them and they murder them it's gonna happen it has happened it must have have I mean I think it happens a lot in Russia I don't think that I don't believe what Trump said and again I think this is what Trump has a skewed vision of what politics is and because he thinks that the outer limit of politics is Russia he thinks anything inside that limit is now okay but do you think it's ever happen in the United States or just in Russia like political assassinations I can't name a specific example of where it has I think that that was you open to the possibility I'm open to the I mean if someone shows me and Johnson Lynda John I don't think Lyndon Johnson wackadoo Kennedy I don't think the Kennedy whack anybody about Hillary I don't think Hillary whack any fired up fired my last thousand bucks I'd be super tempted to bet on black have you super tempted to go you know what I think she went dark a few people let's see what we got here like you wanna see white water I'd want to see Vince Foster I want to see that Enron guy who shot himself in the head twice you what if I could if I could really if I could you know man I think it's happened I just don't know I'm sure it's happened at some point but again if I don't know them and when I'm hesitant to like why I think that we and I think that we tend to think things are regular when they are they never really irregular Yeah right so we tend to think that this stuff is happening like every day and that's why you see Trump on TV saying well Putin like America hasn't killed people and it's like well no not quite like Putin I mean like Putin legitimately murders his journalistic enemies yes like I haven't seen you trying to DoubleTap Jake Tapper so I'm pretty sure I'm sure no it's not a regular thing around here even Obama wasn't trying to like kill Chris Wallace right but maybe they you know maybe well Putin is obviously the extreme example right well obviously the extreme example is the North Korea but Putin is in that range like totally feared essentially a dictator who's I mean they're a bunch of Omer I mean Iran and Turkey Maduro a song yeah Assad Maduro now in Venezuela who's literally oh like a complete dictatorship and this is very recently right but America is a I mean would you believe it if I said like leaders in France had people regularly whacked I'd find it a little bit hard to believe I don't think we're significantly worse than France and the whacking people in politics business I don't think regularly but I think every now and then the move is I'm open to the possibility but I'd have to see the evidence the lawyer and me well I don't think we're a house of cards I don't think it's gets that ridiculous but the point I'm making is if you think that's a regular thing if you think that it's not like a rare thing and maybe once in a while you know once every 20 years somebody gets whacked quietly for political reason if you think that's like a regular thing then fibbing is like way inside the line right right like you you hiding documents is really or you like writing your son's stupid statement about a stupid email exchange and then fibbing about it publicly like that's really inside the line so again I don't think that I think some of this I have a rule about the Trump administration I never attribute to malevolence what I can attribute to stupidity because I think that that's more likely to be the case it's like the Occam's razor of the trumpet ministry that is a smart way to think but I think sometimes malevolence is real like I'd like member the Gary Condit Chandra Levy thing yeah that was weird that was a weird one where people don't know the story this guy was having an affair the girl turned up dead and then 9/11 happened right away afterwards so people kind of forgot about it but they they found her body in the park and everybody was like Jesus Christ like this is a woman that was about to testify that she was having an affair with this guy and that one was a good one yeah in terms not not good one obviously a terrible ones I think so let me say this I think that you know if there's murder in politics it'll probably tend to fall more into the personal than the political mmm-hmm it'll probably fall less in terms of like I have a political vendetta against this guy and I'm gonna kill him we haven't really done much of that since Alexander Hamilton and burr but it's it but there are eminent listened Teddy Kennedy left a woman in the back of his car and a body of water so right drunk driving right that was the thing with him he just didn't want to be responsible for something horrible that he did very similar to Dick Cheney not meeting with the police to feel like something like 18 hours after he shot his friend in the face yeah I mean I don't think he was trying to assassinate his friend drunk hunting and that's can't rule that one out so yeah but honestly I'll find Teddy Kennedy a little more suspicious you leave the woman in the back of the car swim out of the car going to a house sleep come back the next day and my god she's dead yeah well yeah it turns out when you leave somebody underwater for 12 hours they tend to do that yeah that's weird how that works well unless he was so drunk that he didn't know what he was doing which can happen you can get blackout drunk I'm gonna wake up and going wait a minute did I crash my car so I don't drink that heavily is that really a thing like you climbing out the window the card swim out to the river bank go to somebody's house come back like a day later like oh shit there was a girl in the back seat I've never had it happen but I have I've had what I would call slideshow nights you know where I get hammered and then like I wake up in the morning with a pounding headache and and I just just have these flashes in my head like who is that person like where was I where were we oh yeah there was that and then that you eaten breakfast with your friends ago you remember that thing and you go oh yeah Jesus necessarily blackout like I did something horrible and I completely forgot about it but I forgot a lot of it okay but some people I have a friend and he goes gerbil eyes there's which that goes off three or four shots in and he's gone and he's not there anymore he almost kind of like nerf the world around him protect him and get him in his bed and he wakes up in the morning he doesn't know a thing doesn't know a thing about what happened and it's really bizarre it's a terrible things Tim well he's now we're nice to him but your your instinct is to get the fuck away from him he just let horrible things happen but the stories are legendary but he does he gets shark eyes he gets he's black like soulless eyes where he's gone and you go oh no he's gone yeah it's weird but I wonder what that is I feel like that's a neurological issue I feel like if alcohol does that to you there's probably like some switches that aren't connected right in the head I'd imagine there's something going on yeah mmm yeah so Teddy Kennedy who knows I mean he was obviously a raging alcoholic and that could have been a part of the problem I mean literally might have gone home not even knowing that he killed somebody I mean that'd have to be his only defense yeah you'd imagine well that was one of the things that they said they would have used as a defense again with OJ that OJ with the CTE that he might not have even known what he was doing and he might have flown into some blackout rage that note an amazing defense like I would like to hear that like everyone who has CTE now gets to like run around chopping up their ex-wife and randos who end up at their house that'd be a hell of a defense total at the Twinkie defense right yeah well the Twinkie defense was hilarious but there are people that think that you know there's you're gonna see more and more things like that out of former NFL players with massive brain trauma issues it's actually a serious legal question you know like that there's always was a couple weeks ago this kid he doesn't even know he did this oh god oh wow former NFL player Devon hall accused of killing his mother he doesn't remember in jail right not doesn't recall yeah well that's real it's reason yeah I don't find that wildly implausible I mean the fact is that we have an insanity defense and what it means is you don't know right from wrong well if you know what you're doing like it this is something to teach in law school if you're sleepwalking you kill somebody and there's no motive so it's difficult to like you need mental treatment but it you should be in jail for that not not really cases where people are like sleepwalking and they think that in their dreaming at the same time so they think that their wife is actually like the this defense has been used where they think the wife is some sort of monster in the room so they like clubbed her to death and then they wake up and like oh that was my wife it's a really creative defense or it's true any one of the two so well if we know that people can go crazy and we know that brain trauma is a real issue mm-hmm the two of them together I mean there's something about getting knocked around in the head where it's so completely unpredictable and then you add in this impulsive nature of their behavior that happens there's something really weird about a brain trauma it causes a lot of very strange impulsive behavior in people they really can't understand even why they're behaving the way they're behaving MMH it's not good obviously this is way off track from politics to brain trauma you don't want a former NFL player being the fucking president and shuts they the CTE study there was a hundred and eleven players and a hundred and ten of them had CTE I mean then you tell me I mean you have more experience at this I mean I didn't find that shocking at all I mean they've been calling people punch-drunk since yeah 1910 so we'll see the thing is when you get to that when you get to the slurring your words part you're so gone like you're already gone there's a lot of people that have CTE that speak really well and they're very articulate and they're very reasonable and you wouldn't even understand that they're dealing with all these this host of neurological issues the by the time your avoid obviously I'm not a neurologist but by the time is it's been explained to me your voice is slurring and you're dealing with like real heavy-duty symptoms like you're fucked like you're so gone like you're you you're you're way off the deep so here's a weird question for you I mean what would you do about it like I think the NFL is gonna start losing viewers because of us I think they are I think you're right and you know I wonder about MMA do you it's a factor I think there's there's two things going on there's the fuckit factor where people like I don't care I want to watch people get their ass kicked it's fun it's exciting people love it it's consensual it's primal yeah and people know what they're signing up for when they do it they know the consequences of it and it's worth a glory to be the guy who do delivers it versus the guy who receives it so I think there's that but then there's also look you know like the Colin Kaepernick thing I think that probably costs a lot of ratings for the NFL yeah there was that poll that came out that said I think of the 12% of people who said that they were not watching NFL games last year 28% of that 12% said that the Kaepernick national anthem thing was the reason yeah I mean it's smaller said he's probably emboldened them they probably liked it and they wanted to watch it more this was fascinating about the cultural breakdown of the country basically white people hated and black people loved it this is this is how the polls were there's like 72 percent of black people thought it was great and like an equal percentage of white people thought that it was just terrible no which is it which is a fascinating look at sort of how race relations work in the country at large is it's actually one of the reasons I think that ESPN has been losing ratings like I used to watch ESPN religiously and now I all I want is to just watch my sports and not be bothered with the politics right as I say I do that during the day there's a pet peeve of mine that every time I turn on ESPN I have to lecture about Caitlyn Jenner or about black lives matter it's like shut up Caitlyn Jenner hasn't even been athletically relevant for since before I was born I was born 1984 well the Caitlyn Jenner piece when they did it for ESPN and I don't know if this is true or not but the word was that her getting athlete of the year or whatever the award was she's a hero a hero of the Year award hero was directly tied to the exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer that make sense they sold the two of them together as a package deal which I buy a hundred percent if you do her if you don't come on where she came from she's a fucking Kardashian okay she's a giant Kardashian that's what she is now notice I'm saying she yeah you're saying she I would say very politically correct yeah I'm not but the video where they circled her house and she was like moving in the shadows behind the drapes did you ever see that no she mean it was like the first time she was revealing herself as a woman so they're circling her house she's this glorious house and like looks like it's in Malibu or somewhere well they're circling the house and it's in the hills with a helicopter like the filming he's like fucking high production value shit this isn't just like hey you know we met with Caitlyn at home Caitlyn tell us your troubles you know like Kristen back the former Navy SEAL you know right who just sits down very reasonably and says this just feels better for me is Who I am right no no that's there was like curtains and shadows and then she starts talking like war wars but man he's like oh god and then there was a weird weirdest part where she said she got surgery but it doesn't make me any I was it wasn't like I was any less of a man or less of a woman before the surgery well this is the case about gender right well then why get the surgery that was like this is well there are there a lot of questions as to the logic of all of us I call Caitlyn Jenner she Caitlyn Jenner is a biological man sorry triggered sorry to break this to some all the people who listened to your show Caitlyn Jenner I had a tweet this week all the people agree with you the number one retweeted tweet I have ever had had a hundred and nine tweeted I think a day ago and has a hundred and twenty thousand likes and it's it was there was a headline from CNN that said transgender man gives birth to translate one was transgender man assigned the female sex at birth gives birth to a healthy baby boy and so I tweeted woman gives birth to boy right because it's a woman I mean this is like that's not a headline I'm sorry like I'm just because the woman believes she's a man doesn't make her a man like biology still exists sex still exists if you want to say she's a woman who feels like a man that's fine if you want to say that and by didn't care if she gets hormone treatments or if she wants to have surgery like it's a free country what the hell you want but when you start insisting that I you that I just throw biology out the window I don't understand why that's any better than I is a religious person saying every time you say something you have to mention God right like I don't have the right to do that to you like well that's idiotic are you fascinated by it are you fascinated by the transgender like the obsession with it yes that's a good way of saying it there's a there's not just a an obsession it's it's compulsory and it's rabid so I think that there's a couple of things that are going on one is that it's it's very dark but I think that there is an element of like this is different and we get to we get to revel in the in the weirdness of it but we're gonna pretend that it's all about the civil rights of it right we're gonna feel like special because we're cuz we're on their side right we're not watching Caitlyn Jenner because it's a curiosity and because it's weird and entertaining we're doing it because we're on Caitlyn Jenner's side but we feel very good so forever yeah right I mean renee Richards was a trans person yeah I mean it's happened throughout history I mean there's there's what was a reading a couple of days ago about a Roman like the the there was something about reports of some trans soldier in the Roman army you know one thousand years ago it's got to be if it's if exist now and it's existed before it was popular yeah I mean there's got to be a lot of people that turn trans now just because it's exciting oh there it is right there a trans soldier in the ancient Roman art that wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't be surprising I'm not shocked no I'm not sure I mean it's a condition I mean it's the DSM called it gender identity disorder and then they called it gender dysphoria it's it's a condition I mean like dysphoria and but that in a lot of people's mind is labeling it somehow are a negative well I mean it is highly linked to suicidality there's a forty percent lifetime suicide rate for people who have this particular gender disorder that seems to me not to be like a great positive whether or not they transition yeah yeah I mean do what you want to do but but the idea that that we as an entire society have to redefine what sex is and we have to blind ourselves to a biology is this is something I'm not willing to do I think that it's actually damaging the kids particularly I'm more than willing to call her a she and chain but you can only change the name once I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner is she because you can't change her sexting change right you change her name to whatever you want I don't care but you can't she Caitlyn Jenner is not a chicken Caitlyn Jenner is not a woman Caitlyn Jenner is a man a biological man and if a man lost his penis and and you know in a tragic accident it wouldn't make him a woman and if he were born with high doses of estrogen in his bloodstream he would also not be a woman right you're that you were determined by your chromosomes and there's not even talking about intersex people like intersex is an actual status intersex is a biological status but this nonsense that if you Joe Rogan decide tomorrow that you are a woman no surgeries nor homo no homer and trip nothing you just tomorrow you wake up and not not decide but you feel like a woman then you have always been a woman we must treat you as a woman you don't have to change anything about yourself for us to even determine whether you're a woman we just like no I'm sorry no I mean like I had mental illness yeah I had a grandfather I got I get so much shit for this but I had this is not me being unsympathetic to people who suffer from a condition that is really tragic and obviously harms people you know in terms of again the rates of suicide and depression are astounding my grandfather was it was a bipolar schizophrenic and it would have not been good for him or my family if people had said to him Nate you're right the radio is talking to you Nate you're right the curtains are talking to you he went that they put him in a mental hospital they gave him lithium and then he was better and he could actually live a normal relatively happy life there's no good treatment for gender identity disorder gender dysphoria whatever you want to call it but to suggest that it is a condition that doesn't require treatment there really it's just that you're actually bringing female again this is a scientific there's no scientific evidence to back this whatsoever even these studies that have been done talking about there's a female brain and a male brain first of all if you say this to a feminist you're a sexist right if you say to a feminist there's a female brain in a male brain and male brain works differently than the female brain the feminists are looking like how dare you well it's also rare times we are allowed to celebrate classic definitions of female beauty when a man embraces him when he becomes a woman lipstick high heels short skirt this is like not Caitlyn Jenner was only a woman when Caitlyn Jenner was on the cover of Vanity Fair and a bustier right right but if he had just said listen I look exactly the same as I did yesterday but I'm a woman yeah if he got a short haircut and dressed like Billie Jean King right it's the reason why the why the media loves Laverne Cox because Laverne Cox has had surgeries and looks a lot like a woman so I don't know who the guy from well the transgender woman from Orange is the new black I never watched that I've never watched that show either but she's on the cover of Time magazine Oh or he's on the cover of Time magazine well there was the woman in that show isn't that the one where the girl who Ruby wrote is that the girl that's Laverne Cox okay that's a woman or man that's man it used to be a man it used to be a man's woman very tricky no still a man but transgender so out of the loop I'm not old man I'm that old man that headline there right it says America's next civil rights frontier and that's the key you have a bunch of people in the United States who are suggesting that they want the next civil rights fight always the next civil rights fight right yes is it the civil rights fight is immigration or the civil rights fight is gay marriage or the civil rights fight is transgenders okay how about this how about there was only one real civil rights fight it was about black people who had been historically oppressed in the United States for 200 years who had been slaves yes we'd been slaves and genders this is correct okay the worst that Caitlyn Jenner had experienced was being incredibly wealthy in a high net-worth suburb this is not to say the transgender people don't you know aren't discriminated against right and some in some areas of American life I'm sure that's true but it's also like behavior is not the same as being born black or being born Asian or being born with you know disabled if if I'm a business owner and I hire you and you're a man and you come in the next day and you're dressed in a woman's clothing saying you're a woman but you still have a full beard like I don't see why I as a business owner I'm expected to eat the cost of that like that seems bizarre to me eat the cost is a great way to phrase it I didn't have a dog in this fight I didn't I I was completely open and liberal about it until there was a case where a man who had been a man for 30 years became a woman for a little less than two years and then started MMA fighting women yes exactly exactly eating the fuck out of these women and not and not proclaiming that he or she used to be a man because what in quotes it was a medical condition that I did not need to disclose like that's not a fucking medical condition right and if you ever watch the fights she's now in fact yeah yeah she wasn't winning because she was skillful she was fucking manhandling these women it was ugly horse it was hard it's like this is it but again it's it's so funny how the transgender movement destroys the feminist movement by living off of the the sort of lies that the feminist movement promulgated so the feminist movement said stupid things like women and men equally athletic proficient well that's not very repeated very recently that there's no biological difference in the genders and it's all social absolute horseshit I mean I'm sorry there's there's no scientific evidence to back that and it's particularly true with regard to actual physical capacity this is just nonsense there's just no scientific evidence but I'm Alan Turing yeah yeah yeah I mean mountain of it my favorite study on this is you know there was remember there's that those commercials about like throwing like a girl running like a girl right there's feminists commercials saying what is it to be running like a girl no true an adult woman and she'd be running all girly and then they would show a little girl and she's running and it's still a little girly but she's running you know like normally it's only it's not more exactly fierce it's it's only society that has forced the little girl to run like woman first of all I have a three-year-old girl she runs like a girl it's not because I'm teaching her that cause her mom runs because she doesn't write but she play with dolls because you're a sexist pig it's because of that my daughter started off liking trucks like in the first year and I give a shit and then and now she likes playing with dolls and dressing up in princess dresses I could care she's a girl she's always been a girl she'll always be a girl but if she likes trucks oh I think that was an issue with one of my daughters too my daughter was a little worried about our girl she's gonna be a dyke she's like no what's the big deal you like lesbians who cares I don't care I do not care and she's like and then she turned the corner and then she got but we just let her be whatever she's in but she was really into like Batman for a while yeah my daughter is in a band then she was into one woman like who cares but is it but but what what's funny about this is that the left kept saying even when I met my wife right who's a conservative and I made her more conservative when he got married cuz that's what men tend to do to their wives but she but she you know we remember early on we had a conversation about this and I said women don't throw like mine and she got like all offended and I said but that's factually true she said right but it's but it's insulting it's like no that's factually true like I'm sorry like there have been studies out of a thousand if you took a woman throwing a baseball and then a thousand men throwing a baseball the woman will throw faster than out of those thousand men this is in the book the sports chain the woman will throw faster than two of those men out of a thousand and we're not talking about like goose Gossage here we're talking about regular human we're talking about the accountant from down the block we're talking about Paul Ryan flinging a baseball yeah right I mean that's not the way this stuff works well that was the counter that Fallon Fox used was that she actually lost to a woman she lost her woman named Ashley Evan Smith but what I said was no this proves my point is you're not good you're just a man well this was you know John McEnroe got slapped all over the lot when he said about Serena Williams she's right Serena was great and all but if Serena Williams were competing he said she's the best female player ever and they were like well why not just the best player ever is it because she's a woman like if she were a man she'd get her ass kicked and everyone was like no how dare you there is something called the universal tennis ranking she drank in the mid ranks of college male players if she were a man and Serena Williams is said like five years ago now I never want to play it like Andy Roddick he'd kill me she did this there was a 200th man in the world who she wanted to just warm up with and they they played it like just a normal match for he won six one six nothing right and he was and he was like ranked 200th in the world and the only shock was that he dropped a dropped a point to her well there was the issue of renee richards when renee Richard started playing tennis against women and kicking their ass and he was a middling player at best as a woman or as a man rather but as a woman he was a fucking killer hey I mean this is what should insult feminists it turns out the Caitlyn Jenner when all these hero of the year awards and everything we men are so great that even when we decide to be women we're better than women that was the woman for six months but he's amazing he's incredible he's just he was a natural even if being women than women no wonder feminists are piss and they should be and and it this whole glossing over the the difference between feminists who have been claiming that women are distinct from men and important and different and better in certain ways like I don't understand how you hold these two simultaneous thoughts Hillary Clinton needs to be president because we need a female president but also Donald Trump if he said he was a woman tomorrow would be a woman how do you hold those two simultaneous thoughts I always thought that in the last week of the election of Trump thought he was gonna lose you should have just declared himself a woman and then he too could have fires a woman I'm the best looking woman ever I've been I've been voted as the best looking woman of all time the great arguments that I got in online when I wasn't even arguments but so many people were calling me a bigot because of this Fallon Fox thing goes it was stunning because it was so confusing to me I'm like I'm talking about defending a biological woman like you these biological women at least two of them got the fuck beaten out of them by Fallon Fox before they found out that she used to be a man I'm like that's not an issue to these people and so this one woman said she's always been a woman and I said okay she gave birth she impregnated a woman and got her pregnant I go what about then she goes even then yeah even then she was a woman she was a woman she went she was fucking a woman with her dick and getting that woman pregnant like we are in Fantasyland it's it's it's crazy town so this doesn't mean this is what's crazy like you can't just because something's illogical you can't just decide it someone's a bigot like that you're you you were in a weird area we're talking about bone structure and here's the crazy density there there there's a crazy thing is that they always rely on these gender reassignment doctors to define the terms and it's really interesting because I got deep deep deep into the rabbit hole with this because I was really shocked at how many people were angry at me yeah and there is one doctor who is a board-certified endocrinologist who sort of broke it down she's like not only is the science behind this crazy but when you have gender reassignment surgery one of the big issues with men transitioning into women is bone density who she's like when you have gender reassignment surgery you're taking estrogen which actually preserves bone density she's like not only do they have less bone density once they become a woman they might have more well because you're preserving it like it's not you're not gonna automatically be just like a woman in a year or so I don't think surgeons I mean I know too much about doctoring from having spent 1,000 years with my wife's medical education to believe that doctors have the capacity to magically change a man into a woman no maybe it's gonna happen one day with like CRISPR or something like that when they start using you know genetic birth maybe and if you actually entered the chromosomes before birth but no I mean like no if it once once you're didn't once your genes have been defined once your chromosomes in default like this is fifth-grade science people its fifth grade science what scares the shit out of me is when you hear these stories about people deciding that their child who's like eight or nine years old that beyond belief it's scary because you can nine year look a fucking 17 year old doesn't know that was the thing about the Ruby Rose girls she was saying that when she was young when she was a teenager she wanted be a man she wanted to be transgender and that she had gone through that phase and now she's so happy that she didn't do anything right well they say that that eighty percent of kids who experience any sort of gender dysphoria as children grow out of it so when you have a society that reinforces it and then in Canada they're now having their passing laws now that say that if a kid says you know you have a girl and the girl says I'm a boy and she's three that the government can come into your house and take the kid because obviously if you if you don't want to humor the kid and get the kid treatment or surgery or hormone blockers then you're obviously doing something wrong to the kid this is just it's insane first of all if anyone tried to do that with my kid I would meet him at the door with a gun I mean that this is this is the kind of stuff where you're talking legit Civil War like when you say that the government can take people's kids from them because the government knows better than you how to parent your kids on basic things like are you a boy or a girl that's gonna get violent pretty quickly if you send someone to my door with a gun saying I'm taking your daughter from you because your daughter says she's a boy at school and you and you're not gonna take her to a psychiatrist to start her transitioning process oh no but one how did we get so far down this rabbit hole of insanity and this is again this is not taking away the personal choice of a 60 year old man like Bruce Jenner who decides he wants to be a woman you want free country go have at it have a good time but how did we get so crazy that that becomes an option that people aren't they're not paying attention to the the the massive variables that a child encounters psychological variable stress variables what's going on in the home what's happening hormonal e what's happening psychologically what is happening to you and how how can you decide like this is it your get you're gonna allow this kid to make a like a locked-down decision to begin gender transition surgery at like 9 or 10 years old hormone blockers in there to an eight-year-old yeah and you know and then they'll show you like this girl who's like 13 who used to be a boy and you know you see her act and talk and they go how could you imagine that this isn't a girl okay I don't you know I don't know I don't I don't know I mean I just don't know what happened I'm gonna go with the fact that there's a y-chromosome in every cell of that person's body except ironically for some of his sperms to tell me that that's probably a boy and and yes you can block the manifestation of some physical characteristics that does not change the chromosomes and there are legitimately intersex people right mean they're people who legitimately have conditions like Klinefelter's syndrome I mean they're like these are these are actual biological things but if you're telling me any boy can be a girl no no the answer is no and it's that's that's not biologically correct and you're not doing any sort of service to a child especially we evidence less I mean you know you're doing no service to a child by bringing by humoring what is obviously a mental condition and a mental condition by the way again linked forty percent lifetime suicide rate is higher than any other population on planet Earth by a whopping margin I mean telling kids that we are going to force you into the like you express when you're five that you think you're the opposite sex and now at eight we're gonna transition you into this and your suicide rate is exactly the same as somebody who didn't do that railroads very similar to someone who didn't do that and and like this is somehow supposed to benefit the person it's just it's it's beyond imagination I think it's cruelty well it's very strange for sure and as someone who doesn't experience gender dysphoria I like to mean i when when someone's got some sort of an issue whatever it is whether you call it an issue or a condition or whatever the fuck it is and I don't have it I try to be as as standoffish I tried to be as objective I tried to be as as kind as possible this is a weird one though this is a weird one because it's it's become some sort of a fad and any criticism of it whatsoever even discussion of it you are labels as a transphobic piece of shit yeah I think it's only weird honestly because it's run into the weird sexual politics that dominates in the country because if we were to talk about anorexia which is a form of body dysphoria yes alright or if we were to talk about I mean they're actually something body identity integrity disorder right where people like want to lose an arm and we would be saying well the problem is in your brain it's not in your arm right like chopping off your arm seems a little extreme but if you want to do that like go ahead but if you were a kid and it's in five-year-old wouldn't say oh well this kid's gonna suffer with this their entire life let's just chop off their arm now let's let's prevent them their arm from developing like this is not and to tell the entire society that this is a positive good is is a whole other thing it's one thing to try and people who have a disorder humanely has another thing to redefine in terms of the entire civilization as well as biology in order to fit that this is it's valuing the subjective over the object of science is objective your feelings about who you are is subjective you can have those feelings but once you are trying to translate those feelings into the objective standard we almost all by now you're encroaching on my territory it's not just it's not just you're doing what you want to do anymore you're telling me what I have to do that's a different thing right now when people say that there's this 40% suicide rate amongst transgender people one of the arguments that I've heard is it's because they're not accepted right I've heard this do yeah yeah and that if they were accepted and then they felt themselves and they felt loved for their true self then it would be just like everybody else and I've seen no evidence to suggest that if there's if there is a decrease based on treatment then it's marginal at best but not just for yeah it's is it uniform like I would like to know like is like gender dysphoria is it in a similar percentile as anorexia or what bodybuilders get or what strippers get when they get triple left it's like the anorexic suicide rate I think dysphoria is a weird thing you know it's it's it is met people there's a girl that goes to my yoga class that's anorexic and it's so disturbing sad oh it's it's horrifying it's horrifying and listen I'm not so I'm not saying that we should mistreat people but if again you're talking about an entire society being forced to redefine basic biological terminology right then like it'd be an adult like like live with this I'm happy to treat you with listen what I would hire a transgender person but I'm not going to see I'm not going to change what reality is in order to humor you like if you call yourself Napoleon I'm not going to call you Napoleon or not would you take it into consideration no I mean when you're looking at this still it goes what if someone was really good at their job and someone else was equally good at their job but not transgender would you lean towards the not transgender person because you say well the transgender person they're dealing with a host of psychological issues obviously well I mean I think that you would have to think about you know typical aspects of reliability just the same way you would with and their mental disorder if you knew somebody was was manic-depressive which is super common and you have somebody who's equally qualified he's not manic-depressive you might think well that might have an effect on how they do their job yeah so maybe I mean I'd you know I haven't had enough personal experience with transgender people to know whether it would impact a secretarial job or something probably not you know probably not but it's but again to pretend that like transgenders in the military this seems to me like in a decision that should be made by military people will actually have to determine how much does this impact the job and if you already have a group of people with a 40% suicide rate who have high levels of instant higher levels of instabilities a group not individually as a group and you're choosing which groups to pick from to be on the frontlines in small units living under severe pressure for months at a time you know like is that something that is that what you're gonna go for or is that something where like you'd have to overcome certain presumptions in order to get there yeah I tweeted something that Kristin Beck wrote the other day but when the military band went trump apparently there was not a real bang that was bullshit I mean base track from the sessions thing yeah yeah it's later who's back to 20 my sessions yeah this was the part about that I didn't like like I actually agree that there is a question as to whether the military should be recruiting transgender people because I think that the military has certainly it creates a bunch of questions not just questions about who showers with whom but also questions like okay you have a transgender man does he have to fill the female standards of fitness or the male founder that standards a fitness bra like these are actual questions yeah does it how does it work with troop cohesion where you have a group of men and they have a man he was technically a man but he's did you treat him as a woman like does he have to carry the same amount of stuff is the guy like how does that work exactly does this the cost of gender transition surgery and hormones and psychologists like does that come into play at all here would you recruit from the anorexic community for the military Mike these are like real questions but that said that's why they commissioned to study from general mattis at Department of Defense he was going to look into all of this and then give a report in six months and Trump just sort of tweeted it out there I agree that I think that trumps general you know his general attitude on it is probably correct in terms of what the military's that are doing what what it's not there to do but what I don't agree with is how he did it at all because it's disrespectful to the people in the military or transgender I mean like I wouldn't want to find out in a tweet I don't want a better rationale than two tweets and then we're back to and then we're back to you know like look they're doing more than I I mean they're suffering the military I didn't serve in the military it seems like it would be pretty hypocritical of me to say well it's perfectly respectful to say in to tweets you're out because that's the way it is without any sort of supporting argumentation and he didn't actually implement a policy he didn't give the policy to the Defense Department so they could even implement it the Pentagon says they're not implementing it because they don't have a policy this is a PR thing is a weird PR thing but it really stirred up people in the designed to do right I'm sure well either that or he just felt like tweeting I think that's what I think that's what it was I mean he wanted to shift the conversation and it was the funniest thing about that is that he did it in two tweets and the first half of the tweet was in consultation with my generals and my military experts we have decided that we will no longer accept ellipses ten-minute gap transgender people in the military so there was there was a there is a story of BuzzFeed that was kind of funny they wouldn't interviewed a bunch of people in the Pentagon and a bunch of the people in the Pentagon were like during that 10-minute cab I didn't know whether we were going to nuclear war what right is that first we was like except North Korea's North Korea's missile missile test program Wow yeah this again is evidence you know I think it's an example of even if I think the policy is good good policy done the wrong way is actually counterproductive for the policies that I want to see done like I want it laid out by mattis I want it laid out by Defense Department I want all the reasons laid out so we can have a good discussion over it I don't really want just like thought vomit on Twitter that's just not I don't think it's effective well it also seems that this issue is such a hot issue and it's also an issue that you're not really allowed to have an opinion on other than the standard opinion this is always a woman trapped in a man's body and this is the way it is and by the way healthy this day Guardian notion that it's like a man that it's like the the the soul in the machine and that's the there was a woman and deep down for 40 years who had three children with a man's penis and now is now is escaping there's a Ghostbusters like again have you seen the man in England was it in England no it was Germany the man that identifies a six year old girl yes and so they turned him into a six year old girl so there's this click yes is that clip of me that's gone around the internet a fair bit where I'm talking to a college girl about this and she's saying like men or men can be women and women can be men and I said well how old are you I love that clip why aren't you sixty to sixty yeah and she's like baffled like what and then it finally hits her and it's like well you know ya say it's I think this is what's kind of frightening about the age we live in is that we can't even come up with common definitions of basic things how we supposed have conversations with each other if you can't decide what a man is or what a woman is or or whether a scientific fact ought to be relevant or not you know like like at least we could decide what was a scientific fact or not before and now it's like the subjective has just eaten everything if I don't think it's a scientific fact it's no longer a scientific fact x-parameters of the argument it's become about freedom the freedom to be your authentic self versus biology and right and again be it be your authentic self I don't give a shit they will do whatever you want like you know yeah more power to you but it is no longer about your freedom to be authentic self when you're talking about either legislation that impacts how I run my business or hi raise my child or you are suggesting that it is my duty to humor your authentic self like I think there's a lot of people who do stupid crap their entire lives it's not my job to humor their authentic self I mean I'm Pro drug legalization but I've never done drugs and I think the drugs are stupid you know that don't tell me that I have to like cheer when somebody smokes a joint like do what you want but don't tell me that I have to redefine what I think is good and bad behavior like that's silly yeah it doesn't make any sense and the other thing that it became this weird political hot point where we were talking about bathrooms yeah then it become like the number one toss was easy for people to sort of boil take the argument into that right of course like this what about my children my children we go in the bathroom and a man with a dress is gonna come in he's gonna claim that he's a identifying as a woman and it got to the point where so many people were upset about it that people were boycotting South Carolina remember that oh yeah you know that and this the one I thought was amazing was was the n-c-double-a saying they were gonna remove the final four from North Carolina cuz they passed the the bathroom bill right in North Carroll and I asked online okay so when are you gonna abolish the separate male and female divisions of the n-c-double-a like I mean you've said that we can't have separate male and female bathrooms we're biological males play and you know we're biological males go to one bathroom and biological females go to another so why do you have separate divisions why do you have a whitey of an NCAA women's division in an NC double-a men's division yeah where does this go I mean eventually it just boiled down I mean eventually it goes to one place or another like either we just say this is a step too far it give me a break you know science says no or we say anyone can be anything at anytime a man is a woman and a woman as a man and you know it's in just pick have you ever seen any videos of people that are gender fluid I have seen those videos those videos are fascinating they wake up one day and they're a woman the next day they're our man and son there was a guy on NPR on radio lab on the podcast who transitions at times of stress makes perfect sense to me in the middle of having a conversation I just switched I'm Paul now I'm a man when he's more stressed as he switched into a woman because that'd be really sexist right I mean I think they're like if he was stressed at work and he switched into a woman and started crying that seems kind of sexist to me that's implying that women are the people who cry at work so that is sex also this raises a bunch of other weird questions like okay if you're like there's there's been this again you want talk about weird there's been this this this weird push in parts of the trans community to suggest that a male who doesn't want to have sex with a biological male who says he's a female is a is now a sexist against foam is it transphobic you're a man who doesn't want to have sex with a man a biological man and it doesn't make you gay to do that right if you have sex with the biological man who says it's a woman that's straight sex but if you were to have sex with a biological woman who says she's a man you're gay mmm yeah weird it's definitely weird but I have seen the arguments and the blog posts and the tweets about men who discriminate against trans women who do not want to date trans women and people keep saying well it's it's culturally defines like no that's called evolution have a baby together correct yeah correct it turns out that evolution wants men to have sex with women like I'm sorry to break it to everybody but evolution relies on you reproduction okay if you put that thing in the wrong place it ain't gonna reproduce like that's just sorry I I don't know I don't know why I have to keep apologizing for science and and then they say that my party is the party of non science like what like you say that two minutes before my baby is born it's not a baby and a man can be a woman but I'm anti science I'm just I'm wildly confused by this well the whole thing is wildly confusing but it's just it's such a strange subject it's such a strange subject that's been brought to the phone I think it's about more than moral posturing than it is about people who actually think this is a major issue I think you're absolutely right and I think people love to be virtuous they love to be on that side they left a virtue signal how dare you yeah how dare you with dicks or lack of fake dicks but they don't really have a lot of fake dicks they don't really go that far they just sort of take testosterone and see what's up but it's just it's a it's a weird facet of our society today that is uh unexpected I mean you go back twenty thirty years and it was an oddity and you know even there during the renee Richards thing it was it was more of an oddity than anything this is why I say I think that it's I think that a lot of people who are virtually signalling are still treating it as an oddity they just won't admit that right I think that they're watching it because it's a circus to them and I think that's actually cruel I don't think that you should like put people who suffer from mental illness on the cover of magazines I just don't I think that that's bad strategy what about body builders I mean you know I don't know that I'll be honest with you I don't know that much about bodybuilding I mean look like I know that more of a marathon runner what I've heard the argument about body builders they suffer from it as well is that in order to get that big you almost have to have some sort of a body dysmorphia you have to not understand how insanely huge you are yeah I'll be really into it their argument is they're really into it and which makes sense to me but I've heard people say that that it's it's like we're almost like a reverse anorexia like they never feel like they're big enough yeah I've seen that people say that before yeah well it's weird that the human mind is suspect or subjects really variable and it's really open to suggestion really open to suggestion there's people above children transition for sure for sure I mean listen you you see it in everything including fashion like how many dudes wax their chest now 30 years ago nobody wax their chest do they waxing dudes are waxing Jeff shave their chest wax their chest whenever whatever it is questions about the youth or turn to young Jamie yeah but I mean you watch TV now and every dude on TV has a chest as bare as my you know 14 month old sons area and it's like where did this come from and this game was great then one work chiseled it also came from TV and was it like TV it was gonna be men are gonna be hairless now this is this is the new trend men are gonna be hairless mmm you don't even get the Burt Reynolds like you know bare chest anymore and so if people are susceptible to even that with regard to fashion like people will have first for five years people convince themselves that skinny jeans or a thing you know what people are open to virtually any sort of suggestion bell-bottoms to come in they come out and when they try to bring bell-bottoms back I did not a good coffee they tried and people like nah not this one platforms when these two are platform shoes that's what I'm just keeping around on my dad's old clothes because eventually they're they're gonna come back in again you never know yeah the idea of fashion and culture also being like the same sort of mechanism that allows people to be variable when it comes to their gender and that's I mean you actually said there's a study I thought this is chastening there's a study in Britain or Poland Britain about sexual orientation and what I found was 95 percent of people over the age of 60 identified as exclusively heterosexual of people who are under the age of 30 only 42 percent identified as exclusively heterosexual it was like okay well in two generations it's not that half the population became bisexual right that is not a scientific thing that means that people are open to suggestion about their sexual behavior which you would assume hmm right so so assuming that culture has no impact and this goes against the whole you born this way aspect of even the homosexual rights movement the gay rights movement that says oh you were born this way agree that there's a genetic component to sexual behavior but the idea that that's what why 50% of the UK population has shifted toward you know I'm open to anything the culture has some thank you person as I say 95 percent people over the age of 60 and then 42 percent of people under the age of 30 so that's it so that's 42 percent say no okay no 42 percent we'll say they're extremely extremely a heterosexual extremely forties exclusively heterosexual so 60% nearly 60% 68% say that they're on the spectrum but not exclusively heterosexual that's fascinating I wonder if they only talk to women or drunk like young drunk girls they get crazy like if you think I'm trying to you know laughing right we're Adam Adam has a whole shtick about like in the future there's gonna be a point where guys are considered gay if they won't kiss another dood like what are you gay you afraid that you're gay kiss another dood and show me you're not gay we've gone we've gone around the bend a little bit we have well there's also this thing that I think happens when you have two very clear sides you know where you have teams and you sort of have a line in the sand you're not supposed to cross there's the right side and there's the left side and we have that in this country we really don't have a third party option no there are third parties are kind of a joke and whenever you have two opposing viewpoints people dig in if you've seen this new documentary about William F Buckley and gore Vidal and the debate is any good it's great it's really interesting debates they had during the 1968 election it's fascinating we have watched some of those debates but yeah it's intense yeah particularly the one where Buckley threatens to punch fit all because I'm a queer and says I'll sock you in the face and you'll stay plastered it's weird because it's spectacular and it's such like it's so in the the speak of the day you know the Brahmin accent it's great like it's almost British accent yeah it's fantastic it's really interesting and then but but the these I mean it's that thing this my team versus that team and I think the left is guilty of it as much as the right is guilty of it it seems like it's it's a real issue where there's a lot of people that have ideas and opinions it's sort of crossed party lines but they vote on one side or another and they vote for their team I think that's right I think that especially in this last election I think that was true I think that people felt so alienated by the other side like to understand a lot of people who voted you have to understand that there are a lot of people in the country who felt insulted by the left they were just sick of being called the racist sexist pig at homophobes every time someone wanted to advance a policy on the left and so they said okay screw that at least Trump's not calling me that bright so I'll do that and then they're a bunch of people on the Left who now feel insulted by Trump's even presence and they think all the people who voted for Trump are those people and so they're fighting racism sexism bigotry and homophobia by voting against Trump again it would go back to this day and there there's a hardening of there's not one bubble in the country there's two you know the right likes to accuse the left of being in a bubble in the coast there's there's a bubble on the right too which is the idea that everybody on every piece of the media is lying to you right there's always fake news everything is fake news you don't like it it's fake news these bubbles are not healthy for the Republic I mean we can't have conversations with each other if we if we do this routine no deception is not healthy across the board and there's another thing that's going on where everybody's a Nazi like I've never heard people called a Nazi more than I have over the last six months I mean it's been crazy if you support Trump you're not see you're a neo-nazi you're here somehow or another you're a fascist if you didn't vote for Hillary you're a Nazi like we some people have boiled it down to like the purest form yeah I agree I mean first of all it demonstrates tremendous historical ignorance forget the Holocaust like you just look at what who Hitler was and the prophecies he promulgated like he was basically he was all over the place when he wanted to talk to socialists he was a socialist when he wanted to talk to capitalist he was a capitalist he was he was a top-down government guy for sure but he would speak the language of you know what would be considered the European far-right today on a lot of a lot of issues but then he would talk about redistribution of resources and universal health care and all this kind of stuff and removing guns but he's just a convenient Club I mean that's just a convenient Club because then and then to this part that scares me once you say that somebody is Hitler and then it actually becomes obligatory to physically resist them then we can say you can't have a conversation with Hitler yeah like once you say somebody's Hitler the KKK what are you what are you gonna do let have a conversation with them at the very least you won't talk with them and at the most two might try to punch them that is really a problem with that those the nomenclature right that's really a problem with identifying someone in that way that they are someone that you have to resist and they are someone who cannot be reasoned with they are someone who is absolutely evil there's no like variables or variance in their behavior and listen I like fiery political rhetoric I find it fun but I think once once you label somebody you know completely evil you you you have responsibility not to debate with him the first one's going not to talk with them even the conversation legitimizes them yeah I mean that like I mean listen I'm sure you're gonna get a bunch of shit from people for even having me on because the idea is gonna be well how could you have on somebody election period or legit amazing his point of view by having him on I know a lot of people who I pull it eclis disagree with who have had that experience what will have me on their show and it's like how dare you have Shapiro on because you're just granting him cover you know like or we can just have a conversation and maybe we'll disagree maybe we'll agree yeah I'd really don't give a fuck about those people I think that's a silly conversation III feel like you should talk to everybody and if you disagree or agree I have friends on that I my friend yesterday I had on Eddie Bravo he believes in everything's a fucking conspiracy I disagree with him wildly and I love him like a brother I don't think you have to agree with people and I don't think you have to at the idea that you can't just have a conversation with someone about something and see if he can find middle ground or see if you could clearly define their point of view or find their perspective that's missing today in a weird way and one of the weirdest things about the election was the ping-pong match between the left and the right has played out on national television by the media I would watch especially cable news I would watch fox news and then go to CNN and go back and forth lip channels you know you have that previous channel but yeah on the directv i would just put it on both of them go what what world's my mom said this in 2012 with Romney and Obama if you read the right-wing media there was no way Romney was gonna lose and if you read the left-wing media there was no way Romney was gonna win and she said which one of these do I believe in it sounds probably somewhere in the middle like I have a basic rule which is that if you have a New York Times report and then you have a report from my site The Daily wire and they share the facts you can probably assume the facts are true but the opinions that are you know embedded with the facts those are opinions right and that's what's so hard about I think the modern media landscape is trying to separate the facts from the opinion and so this is why when Trump says fake news he's not wrong that CNN hates him and the New York Times hates him that he's right about that but just labeling it all fake news is inaccurate also because most of what they're reporting is true right it's just that it's biased something can be both true and biased yeah I'm true and biased right I say things that I think are factual but I'm obviously conservative that's my point of view you know touch it so that's and you're a commentator right that's what you do I mean half of it is you know riling people up saying provocative things I mean that's it's this is and this is where I think the right is correct about CNN in the New York Times and some of the other networks like though if that's the right what pisses you off more CNN or the MSNBC most people on the right will say CNN not MSNBC because MSNBC is honest enough to say we're on the left and CNN pretends we have no bias we remove all that same thing with the New York Times you know we're above all that and then they run the most egregiously biased headline so we go well that if they're lying about that they're lying about everything you know one of my fast my most fascinating characters if this whole play was Scott Adams and particularly because Scott Adams and when I had him on my podcast he was saying he doesn't even vote yeah he was like what I am what I am paying attention to he goes I'm a trained hypnotist and I'm paying attention to the powers of persuasion and I'm looking at trends and I'm making some predictions that turned out to be accurate and he's like he's looking at trumpet he's not talking about trumping these glowing terms he's talking about him as being an effective persuader and he lost millions of dollars because of that opinion talking about a guy that he's not even gonna vote for I mean this is all leading up to the election where people were fuckin furious at him yeah and even more furious at him after Trump won because he would do those coffe with Scott things he does on periscope where he wakes up but he's just starts asking questions and he's so measured and calm and I did he had a podcast recently with Sam Harris where I think he was just like a little too far over the edge of apologizing for some of trumps behavior and and sort of attributing some of trumps behavior to that you could say was incompetence and in tribute to the like some some sort of a master but this is my only quarrel with Scott I think is that he tends to believe that everything Trump does is 987 degree underwater upside down Hungry Hungry Hippos like everything is it's all just apps of genius and it's three steps down the road instead of like stumbling his way to victory okay I knew everyone involved in the campaign like every single person who's involved in the campaign I knew this was a stumble their way to victory like it is amazing the minds human beings are we need to think it's sort of like the Joker says in the Dark Knight we need to think there's a plan we always need to think there's a plan and so if Trump won it must be because there was some master plan that he unveiled over the course of the campaign three weeks before the election he was caught on tape saying that he wanted to grab women by the p-word no there was no master plan okay it's just that Hillary was an awful candidate and no one liked her okay the idea that the Trump was like even the idea that there was like broad national movement for Trump that wasn't there for other candidates he won fewer votes in Wisconsin than Mitt Romney didn't he won the state and that's because no one liked Hillary I mean this is the untold story of the elections this was not a referendum on Donald Trump this was a referendum on Hillary Clinton particularly in the heartland and people hated her guts right Barack Obama won Ohio walking away everyone talks about Michigan and Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin nobody talks about Ohio Trump won Ohio walking away one of the reasons he want Ohio walking away is because in 2012 Barack Obama really drove out the black vote the the percentage of the black vote typically in Ohio it's like 10% of the general vote in 2012 is like 13 to 15 percent of the general vote and that was the entire margin of victory for Obama in the state of Ohio Hillary got you know closer to sort of the traditional percentages and she lost in a whopping blowout in Ohio no one likes Hillary Clinton in the left was so arrogant that they thought we can take the most unpopular unlikable unqualified nasty boring human being anyone has seen for 20 years and will run her she's the one we'll run but do you understand how incompetent you have to loot it how incompetent you have to be to lose to a celebrity game show host like like you have to suck at this in a royal manner I don't know now now the thing the floodgates are open but don't you think senator big rock man yes oh he's gonna win the primary if he didn't win the primary and then he would have to run as an independent then he'd be indie-rock right kid rock is gonna win the primary oh well we can only hope once he's in the office he grows into it he becomes adult Rock how is Ted new do not run for office yet that's what I want to know how does he not you know him rock give me a conversation about running for president you know and that you know if the people really wanted it he would do it I was like oh good Jesus oh I just can't wait for the rock Oprah you know the rock might win The Rock might win on it if Oprah ran in 2020 yeah she the rock with Oprah it's a fucking dual slam-dunk of me yeah the rock and Oprah together so I have this weird idea that we should actually reinstitute a monarchy and it should just be ceremonial and they can be a celebrity right I'll just make a celebrity monarch okay and that person will just be there to look pretty and so what Queen of England exactly but don't really have anything no power no power because we keep conflating the presidency with like who actually has to do things right with like people who want to represent the country yeah we have unpopularity contest see who gets to control the nukes which is insane that's pretty wild that's pretty wild I think that you know this is we all think in in cinematic terms now and you know Hollywood is run by the the dopiest jackasses like I grew up with all these people right these are not people who you want controlling the narrative and then we're like you know what let's take if Tom Hanks would only run if Tommy what makes you think Tom Hanks would be a good president like did you look at trumpeting what god he's doing such a brilliant job but we really need now is the guy from castaway we need is an actor again we did well with Regan we need another actor we did great with Schwarzenegger as the governor hey at least Reagan was governor for 20 years before he before he was the President of the United States I mean let's let's put him let's put him through the wringer I mean Schwarzenegger proved in eight years that he was not capable of doing anything except kind of sucking well you ever heard him talk about it the way it from his perspective he's like you don't really understand how much red tape and bullshit you have to go through he goes I would meet with people and they would agree with me that it's a good idea however they would say my voters are never gonna agree with it so I'm gonna oppose it even though I know you're right there's a bunch of farmers that are gonna be mad at me for doing that so I'm not going to do that well this is the other thing in politics that really drives me not so there are two promises that politicians make that are complete bullshit the first promise they make is I'm gonna go to Washington DC and I'm gonna get things done no you're not okay the system the system is built for gridlock it's built for gridlock it's where we have two separate houses of Congress it's why we have a president who can veto is why we have a Supreme Court that rules on cases is built for grid lights why we have States that are supposed to be able to check the federal government all this is in the Federalist Papers it was built for gridlock and some people are happy with that because that's how Trump is being like sideline that every time he tries to make something really important I think we all should be happy with that because the only way things were supposed to get past was with wide public support right which is probably a good thing we don't want the government shifting wildly and veering on its axis every four years or every two years I like the gridlock my big problem is that the gridlock now protects a huge system that I don't like that's been built up over a hundred years and in the case of growth of government but I like the gridlock but that's one promise that's made and then people are disappointed oh if we get in there we're gonna repeal Obamacare it's like no you're not you're not I mean like you can promise it but now you're not gonna do it because you're full of crap when you said it and now you're not going to do it and the gridlock is there and it's hard to change things you know it takes a tremendous effort of will and electoral power to actually change things in a big way so this idea will let Trump and Trump like Trump would say it's not gonna be so easy it's like no it's not it's it wasn't easy for Obama Obama passed Obamacare and that was it for his presidency can do anything for the next six years right there were no major pieces of legislation nothing happened after that he lost Congress and that was it okay so that's promise number one the other promise is your anger is justified and this is one I hate even more and that is the idea that you know in in regular life when you have kids I have kids when your kid is angry the first thing you have to teach your kid is maybe you're wrong to be angry sometimes your anger is not justified if you want to make good human beings you have to determine whether they are right to be angry is is your anger correct politicians are in the business of justifying people's anger oh you hear this about the Trump voter a lot right they're so angry they're so angry okay well I'm angry too about things but are they angry about the right things right and Trump would say you're right to be angry because you've lost your job in podunk Ohio because it's being stolen by the Chinese or by the Mexicans or something and it's like well is that factually true or you just are just pandering to the anger and on the left you hear people say this to black folks in the inner city it's the system that's keeping it down it's a racist white supremacist system that's keeping you down then well is that true or I just pandering to the voter because it's hard to tell people hard truths why you're not right to be angry get off your ass and do something with your life and this is true for regardless of race you know go out there no one cares enough to stop you and your life your life is your own no one in the United States cares about you wants to stop you wants to throw obstacles up in your own way I'm not sure you can win an election on the basis of go live your own life even though everyone keeps claiming they want to live their own life I think most people are full of it I think most people don't want to live their own life they want a politician to tell them they're all of their complaints about life being unfair are justified and the politicians gonna solve all that we don't want people who stay out of our way we want people to be mommy men and you know that's that's a tempting a tempting proposition for politics there's certain a lot of that when you're talking to adults because you're dealing with people that have the momentum of all their failures in life and all the different things that are not going right and then here they are at this moment today right now and they want to figure out why and why they're not on track and how to get on track and the easiest way is to point the finger or blame someone else and everybody has their own hand I'm not saying that people's hands are fair and that you know it doesn't have it easy a lot of people that have it easy I have it easier than a lot of people for sure for sure absolutely but the reality is there's a tremendous amount of psychological factors that go into why someone does or does not succeed and to placate them or to you know to play on those psychological factors as you know not being their own fault it's very tempting because it works with people people love to hear that they love to hear that it's not your fault yep and I think that's what politicians have become in the business of doing and it's both right and left it seems people saying that it's it's not your fault because you're being screwed by some foreign country it's not your fault because the immigrants are doing it to you um it's not your fault maybe some maybe some of that's true but you have to show me why it's true you have to show me what the actual like did you lose your job because of and because of China or did you lose your job because you're in an industry that is being crowded out because of technological change and because your unions struck and created wages too high to be globally competitive like let's look at the actual logic here is to and out and then how can we change it how can we make it better how can we is it something we have to do or is it a matter of you need to broaden your skill set like you see a lot of people now who are stuck in the mindset of 30 years ago that you're gonna work and stay there for twenty years and then you're gonna grow and then you're gonna you know leave with gold watch and that's not the way the job market works anymore I mean if you're if you're entering the job market right now as a college student you can expect that in the next ten years you'll probably work four jobs you know like the the turnover is too great and you have to be constantly increasing your skill set also with every new innovation there's businesses that branch out and become new and then there's also businesses that die and there's no bringing them back you're not going to bring back the printing press no there's a lot of stuff that but for the guy in the printing press industry you tell them that try to get elected from the printing press guy well I mean right now they're trying to stop automatically wrote like within the last day or two to try to block automated trucks yeah yeah because there's a tremendous amount of people that yeah but it's gonna be a lot more efficient when it's not people and you know that this is the great fallacy that's been people have been trying to fight since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution as this idea okay well the new technology is gonna kill jobs and then no one will ever work again we've had the same unemployment rate in this country for the last hundred years and the technology is a little bit better Teamsters convinced Congress to block driverless trucks that's yeah that's crazy crazy seems crazy it seems like you're fighting an inevitable tide well I mean imagine that like how is that gonna work for all the other industries that are affected let's say that you now have you're artificially raising the prices of all the goods that now have to be brought in by the Teamsters and now it's more expensive so it's more money out of your pocket in my pocket that's that's money that I'm maybe I was willing to buy American but now I'm gonna buy Chinese cuz I have to feed my family like this is that's not how economics works it's just not how economics is there any argument that they're not ready yet that these that's one of the issues is that with a lot of these so the automated trucks basically in order for them to work you need dedicated lanes because otherwise human error is is something that if like if there's a Google car on the road and you're a bad driver the Google car is probably gonna get in the crash or maybe more likely getting a crash than if we're human driving have you ever seen people freak out those Tesla cars and see what they could do to them I haven't I haven't seen those tests I actually saw somebody do two Google car when you're when a car is on that automated thing if you just swerve they slam on the brakes and back up on you like people have done it to people and filmed it when I see people using automated cars it's it's it's not done it's not ready yeah it's the mix again it's sort of like how there's a lot of fuel-efficient lighter cars on the road but they're a lot more dangerous than the heavier cars because the heavier cars the clunkers are still around from 1970 in their tanks yeah there's one through three Priuses how do you feel about universal basic income because that's a subject that comes up a lot lately when Elon Musk is talking about these driverless cars one of the things he's saying is that one thing that we're going to need is universal basic income he said we're going to have to figure out some way to feed all these people they're gonna get taken out of the job market because their jobs are become irrelevant so I think that universal basic income is for when the technology gets so good that they're legitimately are no jobs I don't think that we're there yet so if you have a machine that can make everything basically for free and then there's a bunch of people who you don't need anymore to do work then you can talk about a universal basic income because there's no scarcity scarcity is what creates a need for labor so if there's scarcity in any industry then there's going to be need for labor there's gonna be need for new labor people are gonna still have to you know work on these trucks and deal with technology and the computer industry didn't destroy jobs all over the United States when typewriters went out so I think it's a little premature I'm not sure there will ever be a day when there's a machine that when the Machine Society is so well developed that it can take over all jobs I do think you're seeing a bifurcation in the labor market so I think people who are in jobs like yours in mind like we're lucky this is a creative job it's hard for machines to create but for jobs that are single tasks jobs a lot more of those are going to be technologically driven and so people are gonna have to you know work the right side of their brain a little bit and we're gonna have to train people in a different way but my perspective on universal basic income is when you have a four percent unemployment rate it's very difficult to say you need a universal basic income like it's again 96 percent of people in the labor market who can work are working so that's not that's not that's not suggesting to me that there's this vast underclass of people who are totally incapable of working and once you do that you see what you've seen actually with the disability programs in the United States right we're now everybody's on disability like the fastest growing government program in America is the disability program where people declare themselves disabled so that they can get government pensions basically once you have universal basic income is there an incentive to work and also I'm not sure that you've solved a lot of people's problems like people still see need something to do with their day yeah 16 year-olds do you see who retired and they're dead within three years the utopian idea is that somehow they going to open up these people's inherent creativity and they'll find something Joey I mean how many people say thirty-three using the term hooey yeah I love it it's a again you know I'm never I hope I'd never retire because I just know too many people who are retire and their oh I'm gonna retire and I'm in a Gulf another paint I'm free and six months later they're dead yeah well people enjoy doing things and feeling like they're valuable you know and I don't know if that necessarily has to be a job but it's a very clear definitive test of whether or not you're valuable if somebody gives you money and you get that money you're like look I'm valuable I'm doing something I'm contributing I got a check for my week exactly there's there's a lot of hours in the day and it's gonna be hard to fill that with watercolor painting and beat poetry classes ah I don't know man I'd find shit to do but I see but I I've been fairly self employed most of my life yeah I think I just I've gotten and some people are driven like I would find stuff to do too but it's there is a difference and you know not all human beings are the people who would actually go out and take classes and find things to do do you have aspirations outside of commentary when it comes to politics maybe some point down the road do you think you run for president or something like that I mean apparently anyone can and this is what I'm finding is sure so um but you're a reasonable guy uh I don't know I mean I I like what I'm doing in the sense that I get to work on what people believe which i think is sort of the root of politics I'm not sure implementing is the same thing as I said I'm not sure that the president can get like I'm more focused on getting people to think in the terms that I'd like them to think you know about limited government and you taking control of your own life and I might be able to do more good you know promulgating that message using a growing medium like we're very lucky I mean or the podcast went from having three thousand listeners you know three hundred episodes ago to now we have three hundred thousand listeners a day you know so it's it's it continues to grow so as that crowd continues to grow it's actually harder for me to said I'd want to jump into politics not easier I think the limited government thing to me has always been a fascinating subject because the people that don't want limited government they're always that is the utopian ideal in my mind yeah somehow or another the government's gonna be effective if you give them more money like well this is an argument with a friend where he wanted people to be taxed more because he felt like that money could be distributed to people and you would get like more funding for the Arts was one of his arguments but my thought was like first of all the arts like when their value when people like them they pay for him yep that's not get it and funding for the Arts means you're gonna have like fucking LACMA I'll show the LA County Museum the art fucking box on the ground that someone's calling a piece of art that guy whether you went to it was either in San Francisco or at LACMA where he went there and he took off his glasses and he just put them on the floor and then he stood next to them going you know kind of standing there and kind of stroking his chin seen there were 30 people all around him staring the glasses on the floor it's like it's amazing yeah it's fucking horseshit right that the modern art exhibits like there's there was another one recently with someone like left behind a pineapple yeah I remember this yeah yeah it's just it's crazy it really is crazy and it's all so pretentious and it's also stoking those fires of pretension and making something that's not legitimately creative making it celebrated because you don't really have the ability to create something that's legitimately creative yeah yeah I was pointing this out today with regard to it's funny how a lot of people who want bigger government they embrace states that start to grow the government and then when things go to shit they're like nowhere to be found so Venezuela is the most obvious example right Venezuela has turned from what was the richest country in South America and had the best oil reserves of anywhere in the Western Hemisphere basically they've turned it into just a garbage heap people waiting in lines have a friend named Nami Horowitz who went down there did some documentary stuff down there and he was I think his cameraman got shot he was who's watching people like literally shooting dogs in the streets for food and this is I mean it's Caracas is the most violent city in the Western Hemisphere now and all of this is because Hugo Chavez was a piece of garbage who centralized all power to himself redistributed the wealth to all of his friends and cronies and then and then supposedly up did the poor accept that now everyone is poor Wayne Ranney wasn't he friends with Sean Penn I don't even know what you're saying exactly so so I'm my show today I played like Sean Penn and Jesse Jackson and and that Freak Jeremy Corbyn who's the head of the Labour Party in Great Britain and they're all just praising Chavez right he's the great guy he was a hero to the poor and now Venezuela's going to shit and we're all these people like what would someone stick a camera in Sean Penn split face like now and just ask Sean Penn so like five minutes ago you were saying this was awesome but there's got to be some sort of a left response for that like what what is their take on the no true Scotsman fallacy right though well you know this is them living on it's because they never really got rid of enough private industry if they'd just gone further it would have been better it's like low Soviet Union and didn't work out that great either but like I got actually got a response it was really funny today I tweeted out that according to the World Bank Venezuela has one of the least income unequal societies on earth so it's actually pretty income equal reckons nobody has anything right and then it's garbage and so the the Socialists the official Socialist Party tweeted me and they said this is because socialism has never truly been tried okay all right sure well the wonderful idea of socialism is that it's going to even everything out and that you shouldn't get paid more for that no one should get paid more and then everyone should have some sort of a like a peak that you could reach right and think there's some sort of competition involved there's got to be some there's got to be some sort of incentive but only so much right this is like the Bernie said this is democratic socialism like formal socialism is the state owns the whole thing but democratic socialism is there's private industry but only to a certain point and then we tell people no no then you find out about Bernie and his wife and his wife's idea was to buy up a bunch a land and expand the college and then the fucking college went under and now they're being sued vacation homes yeah come on man it's all based on a lot of myth making about like Western Europe and and the Netherlands right so there's always two outs democratic socialist countries they're working great first of all a car in Denmark has a 60% import tax and costs literally twice what it would cost in the United States tax rates in Denmark are insane except for corporate taxes which the left in the United States really you know they love corporate action they want those higher Denmark has some of the lowest corporate taxes and regulations in the industrialized world so everybody is coming in and investing in Denmark it's only the citizens who are getting screwed by paying for this giant welfare state then their GDP tanked and now they've had to elect right-wing governments to slash back the the level of government I mean it turns out that capitalism is the great engine that dry like Singapore is there's nothing on Singapore right Singapore is like a rock ok City there's nothing there Singapore has one of most powerful economies on earth because they basically have no business regulations no taxes and no tariffs so you need whatever you want and when people can do whatever they want they make a lot of mutually beneficial exchanges end of story this is not that difficult but but it is difficult if you think that life is unfair right so what would you propose like what would you propose for the United States like the United States obviously what Trump wants to do is reinvigorate manufacturing make things in America again bring back the labor force make take away the jobs that are going to overseas and other countries in South America so I think that that's a bunch of slogans from him and I don't think it means in it so so number one I don't think a manufacturing job is more important than a tech job right ok a job is a job and in industries that are thriving you actually need more jobs and in industries that are not doing as well if the jobs disappear that's just the wages of a global economy and that's I know that sounds harsh to people who are in those industries but it's not a referendum on you or your value it's just saying that certain industries over time always you know are outsourced like we used to make t-shirts in the United States we don't make t-shirts here make them in Vietnam and it cost us like five bucks right so the so my view is I'm not gonna privilege ones I understand a lot of this is politics you want a favored manufacturing bases because there are a lot of manufacturing hubs in Pennsylvania Ohio Michigan Wisconsin but then they vote since I don't care right since I'm not a politician my view is that if you want a thriving economy you relieve as much regulation as possible you lower the taxes for everyone personal and corporate you attract as much foreign investment as possible and you allow people to build businesses with this little risk as possible and then you allow them to compete and if they succeed they succeed and if they fail they fail and you get rid of tariffs as well because I want cheap inputs for my products and I want cheap products on the shelves at the store so don't have to pay a bajillion dollars for a pair of shoes so I'm my view of this is that economics is an element of freedom I am a free person I get to do with my money what I damn well and you don't get to stand in my way unless there is some sort of moral thing right like if you want to say let's put sanctions on let's put sanctions on Iran let's put sanctions on China right China's funding North Korea right now it hurts our national security we want to put sanctions on China to try and pressure them into ending North Korea that's a national security thing but the idea that like today Trump rolled out this new plan on immigration and he says I want to cut down on legal immigration but the reason is because I want to raise wages of people in the United States and I think well that's not productive because what you're actually doing is you're restricting the supply of labor artificially increasing the wages which artificially increases prices which means it's not competitive on a global scale which means the company's outsourced right so it's the exact same thing as minimum wage you create a minimum wage you're artificially increasing wages that increases prices that makes it non-competitive people outsource so it actually achieves the opposite of what you're trying to achieve all government intervention in the economy save for interventions that are designed to prevent externalities now things that I do that hurt you all of those are unjustified in my view what about an environmental protection so those are externalities right so like if I were to pollute a river it's not my River I don't get to pollute it right I get to throw my trash over my fence into your yard right that's a that's that's a different thing that's it yeah that's one of the most disturbing things about this administration is the cutting the funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and the changing of their standards removing some of the funding for things like satellites that they're using to track the climate change and things along those lines and that that scares the shit out of me like it scares the shit out of means they're gonna ignore the environment in favor of the economy so I think that some of the environmental regulations are badly drawn and some of them are overwrought when it comes to for example fracking you know Obama pushed a lot of environmental regulations on fracking or the Keystone XL pipeline that kind of thing how do you feel about fracking I'm very much in favor of fracking what do you think about like when you hear stories about more earthquakes happening and in stable water supplies from what I've seen the the earthquake evidence is extraordinarily weak yeah the myth from what I've seen you know I'm again if you present me evidence that I find convincing I'm happy to change my mind on this right and as far as the as far as water pollution again the evidence has been pretty weak so if that changes then I'm happy to regulate it as far as when you say that's been weak there's there has been instances of fracking leading to pollution right sure but that's not every fracking leads to pollution right and so the question is is the regulation or how many are you willing to accept right which is the truth for all business right like how much we all drive cars how much pollution air water bottles somewhere there's a seagull choking on a cab correct so like how much are you willing to accept like what I don't appreciate is when people kind of futz the evidence or it's like oh well I accept my set my water on fire because of fracking it's like no that's not because of fracking that's because of the groundwater but in any case the you know as far as the satellites and global warming listen I think that it's pretty clear that the climate is warming I mean the greenhouse gas effect is a thing the question to me is less whether it's happening and more what are you going to do about it because even the left seems to have no real solutions as to what to do except for massively cutting economic growth and it seems to me that if we're talking about an increase according the IPCC if something like 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of the next century then on average right not not universally on average then it seems to me that it's easier to just say that the climate changes over time and maybe cities that are on the coast are gonna have to pull back a little bit over time like a hundred years a long time a hundred years ago we would have said that the the pollution was the chief thing to worry about in the United States cuz we're all using smokestacks and it's exactly and and now not really even through regulation but just through market competition you've gotten better environmental products so I think that the market does take care of a lot of these things people don't actually want to live in in human waste you know like we actually don't want to do that I know what's been disturbing me recently is how many times I see Bill Nye on TV talking about climate change well he's it again he's he has the same qualifications I do I mean he's like a mechanical engineering degree yeah kind of a comedian yeah I mean I think he is my childhood yes I believe he was like a comedian he's a stand-up guy yeah yeah and he does you ever see is this thing with Tucker Carl which was great Tucker Carlson kept saying okay but you're talking about science so tell me how much of an effect do human beings have on climate change and what what is what's the science Chimay and all he wanted to say was that you know are you a consensus settle yeah exactly and like what is what is the difference or it's changing right give me a range like you don't even have to be an exact number but give me a range and then tell me okay what do we have to do in order in your opinion in order to stop the climate change right where it stands or if we can't do that in order to minimize it what's the actual risk also and people keep giving these catastrophic scenarios where it looks like the day after tomorrow and Dennis Quaid running into subways and shit weirder ones he said was that we were supposed to have an ice age now that's not gonna happen like Jesus Christ man that's good yeah you know Randall Carlson has been on my podcast a few times and he's an expert in collisions and asteroid collisions and one of the things he said is like he goes global warming is not great he goes but it's way better than global cooling this is true cooling kills ever there right though the Little Ice Age was not a good thing for the world I mean the global warm period was actually a pretty good thing for the world so I mean this is this is the other thing is that there are costs and benefits to the climate changing which would hit which it has throughout time right what are we willing to sacrifice in order to prevent in order to make that seven degrees into six degrees right and just losing some coastline is not the real issue intervention is far more devastating right I mean losing coasts so I think that if you're gonna worry about that if you're gonna worry about you know the emissions problem worry about the the the sea absorption of emissions right now like the toxification of the oceans like that seems to me to be a bigger problem than the climate changing over time we're pretty adaptable like there's a lot of land okay so we move we have historically right I mean Venice the the sea-level rise in Venice every year people are going to move I mean like that's just that's the way it works I am absolutely there's this weird idea and it's it's true in economics it's true with global warming that where you were born is where you must die hmm right and then you can never move and it's like well this is the most mobile society in human history we were on a plane and be on the other coast in six hours it's it's easier to move than ever before so if we if you really think that the climate is that bad first of all I'd like to ask Barbara Streisand if she's that deeply concerned about global warming why she doesn't sound a coastline of state yeah but is it's like am I gonna lose a lot of sleep of a bunch of Hollywood stars lose you know five feet off their coastline because we didn't kill the industry of the United States and lose four trillion dollars a year like me no and I'm not really sure that that would have worked that way one way or another the it has been absolutely proven that human beings are having an effect on this carbon dioxide levels of course of course yeah there's a greenhouse gas effect sure a hundred percent so modeling's been so wrong that like I want there's no level of certitude and then there's no level of solution that I know for sure is going to do this so you're talking about human being suffering in the now for the later and let's be real about this like yes there are a lot of emissions from the United States but the leading emitter is on the planet right now we're trying in India and they're not gonna stop this Russian anytime soon like that's not gonna happen well there's also this thing that happens where if you even discuss it you become like a Hitler or a Nazi you become a climate change denier and once you get locked into one of those labels you know you you're a piece of shit well this is and yeah nobody wants to be locked into those labels so they don't want to have the discussion of the debate and that's one of the things that I felt like Bill Nye was not prepared for because I felt like he's so lazy with this conversation because so many people just appease him and agree with it yeah I think that's when Tucker Carlson was challenging him on it he didn't have any data to support this argument he just wanted to sort of like play word games and and have this we you know say well you know you guys on CNN there was one time when when they had some guy on who was saying exactly what we were saying that the models did they have not been proven to be accurate and that Al Gore's movie predicted that we'd be underwater in 2014 he didn't it yeah I mean his predictions in that movie or not correct yeah they're not correct at all whoo and he's made like some insane amount of money he's gonna sequel out this week isn't he like the first billion dollar green guy yeah like he's made a shitload of money off of giving these speeches and cap-and-trade and the whole thing is very strange because it becomes this untouchable subject like what we're talking about before with transgender people or with many other subjects become you can't discuss them they're not even open to debate or Chris they they become locked down and when tucker carlson was pressing bill not like what is what are the numbers like what is happening tell me how much of an effect are we having and Bill Nye had nothing on it and became stammered and started getting angry is like wow this is weird yeah this is weird to see I mean if this is the cause of your life you should know a little bit more about it then everyone who disagrees is a denier and I think the way Tucker handled it was brilliant Tucker's best moment I think on a show yeah I think so too because he was saying essentially he was like I'm not denying it I'm not saying aside I just want you to tell me but the effect tell me he'll be hanged and he had nothing it's like so maybe Bill Nyes the wrong guy to have their I shouldn't be selling himself like you can't have me come on a fucking show and talk about plot global warming because I don't know anything right or at the very least Bill Nye should say listen the you know Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did this study right you can look up the numbers there I don't have them off the top of my head or the numbers right how about fucking numbers you're gonna be on one of those shows seven minutes so everybody in the media is lazy nobody nobody actually does their prep for debate or for TV appearances like because the truth is you think you're gonna be on for fight having done a thousand TV heads at this point most people think ok I'm beyond for five minutes I can get through five minutes right I'm gonna be that bad if I'm on for 10 minutes how bad can it be and the answer is you can get pantsed on national TV in five minutes if the person knows what they're doing well you've done that too many people one of the things that I think is do you talk fast always you're born this way everyone my family talks the family just talks from me as I was wondered if this like was a strategy developed to be really good at those shows no no it's it's it's been fortunate that it that it fits that way but yeah even even my kids don't talk this way even the three-year-old to see some people that are just really good at Baba Baba and you you get them in the podcast and after like Peter shifts a great example after like 20 minutes I'm like you want a drink let's have some whiskey I had a couple of glasses of Clank cheers and we settled down and then he settled into like a normal way of talking but he's just so used to like force feeding you fats and pans and it's just it's such an ineffective way to communicate with those three heads and the the one person who is the host throw the megyn kelly throwing a question this person's talking over that person and it's such an ineffective way to communicate yeah I mean it's one of the things that I do like about you know long-form podcast like this one or like mine I just I like the ability to actually expand on a point yeah on TV it's like okay you have 30 seconds of a point excellent we can make that work for us it's the only place left that you can do this unless you're making youtube videos and you know Jordan Peterson is obviously finding out that that's problem yeah but unless you're unless you're doing something along those lines where no one's there but you and you get to expand and express yourself there's no other form of conversation like podcasts where you're not getting interrupted by a commercial you're just talking and you know as well as I know that conversations sort of evolve and move and they you know when I get to know you better I see how you're thinking better and I kind of have more questions to ask and you expand more and you get to know a person for real and that's just those those television shows are so there it's so divisive and honestly it's hard for me to watch a cable television because of that I don't feel like I'm making tons of information that way well CNN had nine fucking people on the other day that's crazy the panel on CNN it's like it's Hollywood Squares no Anderson Cooper standing sitting there in the middle and there's people and then there's people that I do I made a diagonal cool and they're interrupting each other and said excuse me while I talk you mind not interrupting me for a moment like they're they're grandstanding and trying to have this this point they think is gonna be a zinger because they wrote it last night and it's just like oh the best you can hope for is that you have 30 seconds where you say something that goes viral that's basically this that's the extent of it yeah well you've done a lot of those yeah but it's like we were talking about before that a lot of the people that have debated you that are really they're really fucking lazy like like they have this supposed passion for something but when it comes to preparing for this sort of interaction they're not really doing that they're not for sure and I think that you know part of that is there are people who are experts on particular topics who could I'm sure know more about their specialty than I do on a lot of topics like if I were discussed climate change with a person who was like an expert on climate change I would not know as much as that person sure but you know there are a lot of people who think they're generalists and have never read a book right you know I know one fact about one thing and it's that you're a denier you know and I well I mean if I know two then I beat you well that's that so the climate denier thing seems to me one of the laziest things about the left and this is not saying that there's not some sort of a real issue with human waste because I think there is I think it's a jet there's a giant issue with plastic in the ocean there's a giant issue with pollutants in our water system in our air and there's a lot of issues with the side effects of being a person in an industrialized civilization there's we burn things we create poisons and we've got to figure out a way to be sustainable I don't think there's any denying that by anybody I think it's also worth noting the market makes these things better in many cases I mean the fact is that if you look at the the areas where for example everyone is down on carbon-based fuels okay fair enough but if you go to places that don't have carbon-based fuels they're burning animal dung and wood there's nothing worse for a particulate than animal dung and wood so as we get banned if we if we did even better than than this we would get to nuclear power right which unfortunately a lot of people have banned because of on base fears like most of France's electricity is provided by nuclear power and that's about as clean as it gets so you know I do think this how it goes dark well till it goes to Fukushima a even even in worst case scenario at Fukushima I mean if you're talking about the if you're talking about global warming and environmental damage the amount of environmental damage supposedly done by carbon emissions is a lot larger than Fukushima right but the local damage oh yeah it's devastating that's the disturbing thing that they don't have a way to stop that that like they've figured out a way to like put a wall of ice around the containment area and that didn't work it seems so fucking science fictiony they'd really don't know what to do and yeah I don't know enough about nuclear containment to take off on that one better tomorrow let's just say that one disaster in and basically there been three major disaster right renoble Three Mile Island in Fukushima yeah the only one that's happened two of those three have happened in the first world right Fukushima and Three Mile Island Three Mile Island basically ended up having no long-term impact so Fukushima is really the only major disaster in 40 years of industrialized countries using nuclear power well apparently they had some weird meltdowns here at Rocketdyne weren't really discussed yeah tell about it well they're there you know it's it was all during the 60s 50s or the 60s when they're involved in the rocket program but the Rocketdyne stuff my friend's dad is a scientist who's explaining to me the half-life of whatever was released in the atmosphere it's nothing in concern but there's a bunch of rocket times like return Street there was a bunch of articles that were written about it like worrying about people that have higher cancer rates in this area and you know but there's also like I think there's a website called the sins of Rocketdyne really yeah see if you can find that I think there's a website dedicated to that that people but there's a lot of cancer just living in cities man like they say that one of the worst environments for human beings living in a place that has a lot of brake dust like if you're living in Manhattan and you get your window open you're just inhaling particulates from people there it is the sins of rocket time but the thing is like I mean how much more cancer are these people this is from 2000s sometimes the statistics on cancer are hard to correlate right is it because you'll have groupings that are sort of weird and that's just because random statistical grouping yeah so how much of it is due to X Factor or Y factor if we do that then presumably the cancer race would be going down a lot you know they haven't really in most cases so it's pretty rare you have like a lung cancer situation where smoking obviously causes lung cancer most cancers like breast cancer we have no idea why it happens also the valley itself anything that happens in the valley like you when you drive from like Thousand Oaks over the hill and you look down the valley and like Jesus that can't be good yeah I hear you I've been flying into the valley my entire life and every time you fly into the brown gunk soup that is that is the valley atmosphere you think that's not great yeah you mean that is one area where obviously we have gotten better I mean the smog alerts have gone down tremendously in the last 30 years yeah it's gotten a lot better it's gotten a lot better and but that's also one of the things that Donald Trump has relaxed some of the standards the kind of standards wasn't I don't know the mission standards he changed the car emission standards maybe it's again I wonder how much of the car emission standards like there's there's actually thriving debate and libertarian community particularly about whether cave standards are what drove greater fuel efficiency or whether it was the price of gas that drove greater fuel efficiency that as the price of gas has has risen and fallen you see people change their buying habits right in the 90s everybody but an SUV right and then the prices went up and everybody bought a Prius well the Prius thing is interesting too it particularly the Tesla thing because then you look at the environmental disasters of creating these batteries yes and you're like oh this is not totally green yeah like there's some weird gray area too it's pretty complex and and I think that the one thing we know is that there are millions of people all over the world for all of human history who have been living in absolute penury and misery and we now support 7 billion people on the planet and the rate of global poverty has dropped by 50% in the last 30 years a lot of that is technological change a lot of that is fossil fuel use and so before we you know we always have to ban these are two things that are worth thinking about balancing like and this is what's again a little frustrating is that sometimes you see people on the environmental left will say well this has to be done or it's the end of the world and so well how about those people in developing countries how many of those people you're gonna say have to live in poverty in order for this to happen right and then on the right you'll see people say well no environmental regulations at all just let it all hang out and you know sometimes the market hashes it out and sometimes the market doesn't hash it out and so you know I think a little caution is warranted I think that's a very reasonable point of view and that's one of the things that I really like about your commentary I know you're a right-leaning guy but you're very reasonable you you make arguments that are sound and easy to trace it makes sense well thank you I appreciate it I think we need more of that you know and I think that's it's rare that you find that in a 33 year old guy that's some strange sort of conservative character that travels around clowns so the Berkeley thing is gonna happen when is it gonna happen as September 14th is the date it's supposed to happen dude good luck with all that yeah well you know if they cancel will still del you're gonna go on a bulletproof popemobile yeah hey where's bunny Han so do I do yours this a low profile though yeah we keep it on the DL around here let you when you when you do show up at these places and you see the anti-fur people and they're screaming and yelling cheering and that's got to be a surreal thing that it's just you and your thoughts and your opinion I mean you're not selling babies you're not there slaughtering dogs and this win festival exactly it's weird I think that you know I'm not I'm not arrogant quite enough to think that a lot of those people know who I am I think that what happens is that they're sort of a call that goes out from a select few saying this KKK members coming to campus go would go stop him that's what happened to Cal State LA like when I spoke there there were actually a couple professors were telling their students that I was a closeted member of the KKK you might show up wearing a yarmulke I'm their favorite person I think okay I'm like a charter member it's my thing I was literally in his larry's that year I was kid 2016 is a wild year so I was so David Duke accused me of being a far leftist black lives matter accused me of being a member of the KKK and I was the number one recipient of anti-semitism from the according to the anti-defamation league I was the number one recipient of Twitter anti-semitism in the United States for journalists last year's little trophy at my house green frog it is it's a green frog and then a little model of the gas chambers murder number one yeah by a huge margin by the way hello out it was like 40% of all anti-semitic tweets on the Internet directed a journalist in 2016 were directed to me personally holy shit it was a good year has a good year you know some years are more productive than others what did that feel like well I mean it felt like my Twitter feed was just out a dumpster fire did anybody I get somebody get people emailing me please don't retreat me because I really thought they'd just be hit by waves of these people that's died off yes since the election it's really gone down a fair bit but you know there were some pretty serious you know death threats like I got people calling my cell phone up my security I had it I already had a shotgun but yeah well what what started at all probably me quitting Breitbart so so when I was you know I was not I was not a trump supporter I didn't vote for either candidate in this year's watching or support in the primaries Chris yeah Cruz I support him his positions he was the closest to me politically um so you know I was not pro Trump during the primaries he didn't earn my vote during the general action I thought like there's two ways to look at your vote and this is what I always said to people I said vote for who you want to but for me there's two ways to look at your vote it's a coupon that expires November 9th right and so either user you lose it or it's just it says something about what you are willing to accept and it's possible that there can be election where both candidates suck and you just don't want either of them so what did you do during the election I voted down ticket I skipped the top of the ticket so which it first time I've ever done that so I didn't think either of these people was qualified to be President of the United States once Trump was elected then it was like okay if he does good stuff I'll praise him if he does bad stuff well I'll hit him as I would any other presidents mhm so I've been sort of you know calling balls and strikes with him and some of the stuff like Gorsuch I love and some of the stuff like Mika Brzezinski bloody face I'm not so hot on so it's but yeah so the I think what led off was it was a combination of three things one I'm Jewish too and obviously so too I was working up right Bart and then I quit in the middle of the election cycle after there was that whole remember the Michelle fields incident where a Corey Lewandowski grabs a reporter from ripe are they gone after bruiser and then right did he actually bruiser a bruiser I mean like she took picture she reported to the cops it was you know unless unless you believe she bruised herself it didn't look much like a I mean when I watch the videos like it looked like he just kind of grabbed her arm it looked like he her body didn't like move like she was being injured yeah I mean she let's put it this way she that was her account I was also the accounts of Ben Terrace at the Washington Post right was that she was grabbed hard enough to bruise and then she had bruises you know what let me as a fight commentator there's a lot of things that I see live that look a lot worse than when you watch them on video mm-hm you know when people get knocked out like that wasn't much of a punch like oh you had to be there yeah I mean the most the example that comes to mind is the alley Liston punch right number two yeah might of mine is that that she there were three there are a bunch of different excuses that Breitbart won through on that one one was that she was never grabbed at all the second was it was a Secret Service guy and then the third was that that from thought she was a security threat and Corey Lewandowski had to protect Trump from this 90 pounds soaking wet you know girl and so once Breitbart did that then the real question for me was not you know what a horrible thing had happened to her it was much more about as a journalistic entity do you stand by Europe or do you stand by the candidate who you support and once Breitbart made clear to me that it like I already knew they supported Trump that was in a great shock but I was kind of their token non-trump guy and once it became clear that they were willing to sort of sacrifice journalistic credibility on the altar of getting close to Trump then I was out then it's no longer journalistic outlets I quit and and that sort of started the ball rolling so I really didn't get anti-semitic responses on Twitter before that and not too much not too much so I won't see the Breitbart directed dynamics I don't think they did but I think that there are a lot of people who follow Breitbart and you know my low-key innopolis and they're pissed at me and they'd see me as like an ally and now they saw me as an enemy and this kind of thing so and you know it's a war for them right oh yeah I mean people enjoyed it obviously that's a weird thing about the online hate is how much people enjoy it what's anonymous you never get me never get tagged for it for now it's not us for now for now I mean I've said this to a bunch of college students about you know the alt-right the first of all I think it's important didn't mention a lot of people who say they're alright aren't actually alright just cuz you like a meme doesn't make you alright but like there's a group of people who actually like Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor and the race-based identity politics of white supremacy and those people are actually alright when the alt-right is is coming after you then it's not a lot of fun but there there are a lot of there are a lot of young students who will retweet things from like things that are obviously nasty and gonna hurt them in their future career yeah right where they'll build like be joking around on Facebook and using the n-word and I'll say to them like guys you may think it's funny and ten years from now your employer's gonna find that and you're gonna be toast and there are a lot of people who sort of fall into this idea that what you do online is anonymous and it is not it is not going to remain enough it's just a matter of time for it blows yeah I mean any anonymity in ten years I agree I think that we're moving in that direction and this is actually a thing that bothers me in general like did you follow the entry to the Donald sterling saga yeah sure so it really bothered me yeah I mean did everybody was willing to like take Donald Sterling's team away from him because he said something shitty to his girlfriend right about Magic Johnson when there's no evidence that there's actual discrimination among clients at the Clippers only right again if there are actual evidence of discrimination then sure boycott his team and do what the MBA has to do but like I'm pretty certain that every human being says crappy things to their intimate loved ones about groups of people and other people it was the standard then I think that we're all toast oh for sure in his defense of it was like very reasonable she's trying to get laid he's like I was just I was just saying it was like he thought he was alone he thought he was with her and no one was recording him and she was trying to say that she had recorded all of their conversations that it was a part of her job he's like a senile old guy and he's obviously not with Vee stiviano because she's a Nobel Prize winning physicist I mean like this is it like he bought her a condo and a Bentley and a Ferrari and she's a fucker his interview his interview with Anderson Cooper was one of the classic interviews of all time I ever saw oh my goodness that the moment where he says because there's a moment where he turns to Anderson Cooper says Anderson have you ever fallen in love with a woman in Anderson Cooper who is you know super gay yeah everything goes he starts laughing goes no I've never had that experience well I understand when you do fall in love with a woman and he just get he's so unaware it it's like I'm sorry like I can't consider this guy like he's a KKK threatening figure like the guy can't even like find the toilet in the mornings he's like stumbling over his ottoman like I had I did about him defending him I was like because if you look at what he actually said everyone's like he's a race is a terrible person he said do me if it was I don't he goes don't take pictures of black guys he goes in the next sentence he said I don't care if you fuck them just don't take pictures of them I go in my world that's pretty reasonable like you gotta go you can fuck him she should just like leave well enough alone you're getting a Ferrari out of the deal no I think that was that whole thing was just like it was it was our capacity to get ourselves to outraged so we could show everybody how outraged we work well the president of the NBA whatever the fuck his name is what is Adam silver the guy that got on TV was talking about Italy was the most horrific thing that's ever been said to Jim Crow at clipper at the Staples Center he should have gotten on TV and said look this is obviously we know what this was this is a gold digger and an old man it's a story as old as time he said some stupid shit old people say stupid shit he's an old guy here's the thing don't take his advice when it comes to race and and he probably should have said look but on the bright side he told that she can go fuck black guy so hey everybody's like self-righteous bullshit and well I mean oh a lot of that again is I think that if you look at the NBA statistics and who watches the NBA the the out sighs number of people who watch the NBA are black and this has amount of time watching it and so you know Donald sterling pissed off a lot of black folks with that understandably and so a lot of people were like I think the NBA is like we're not gonna lose our fan base over there was a money decision in other words I don't think it was a values decision as much as money well I agree with you 100% but I don't think they had to make that decision that way I think they could they could have divested him and put him like put his kids or his wife in charge of the team like this idea that you're gonna force him to sell his team it's crazy disband the Clippers because there was a tape of an old man saying stupid ass things to a gold-digger is its to anyway and he wound up making more money from that team that he ever would have so much jillion dollars yeah it became much more valuable the whole thing is bizarre yeah um that's it dude we just hit three hours well that's crazy I appreciate clue bye that's great well listen people been asking for a long time for you to come on so I'm glad we finally got together and yeah me do it thanks for having me my pleasure let's do it again sounds good thank you thanks Ben see you guys see you next week our girls two non-binary folks to everybody all inclusive bye "
"because some other fuckers will say that you were allowed to leave because you agreed to do their dirty work after you left oh no I never I never did I didn't really not that's what I say I would say okay well if I broke into here and I was caught and I was questioned if I was allowed to stay if I wasn't apprehended then I kind of agreed to be a Fed so you did sneak into a Bahamian Crowe that's not it okay so what's back there well it's a 2700 Acre beautiful redwoods 2,700 acres and it looks like Yosemite it's the biggest redwoods you've ever seen but there's not tourists and what would be the purpose for such a facility for searches well the history is no not gonna Mark Twain and others when they were in San Francisco bought the land and set it up as an artist retreat it was very very liberal and then William Howard Taft around the turn of the last century about a hundred twenty years ago they came in and bought it the president bought it with a consortium do they bat with the American public's money no no a bunch of robber barons bought it okay guys then they threw out a lot of the artists but kept some of them okay and then it was just a place to you know let their hair down and do all sorts of stuff and also stuff used to give me an idea you know even back then there was a you know gay stuff going on all six can i but they'd also down the road they built a whole camp and stuff where they wouldn't the women in but they ship in a bunch of hookers and then and then and then they put a railway into it so orgies orgy job but then over time they brought a german death cult over same on they have a skull and bones and ah skullenbones the Bilderberg Group and such yeah and which those aren't a german chancellor came out and he wrote a book men in power as a political retrospect name of the Prime Minister my brains failing but it's political minutemen empowers both my perspective all right and he said oh we have our own rituals in Germany but we really like the ones we do out there and so by by the turn of the knot this decision perform 120 years ago it became super early expected it still took a few weeks to go across the country from DC or New York and so they stay sometimes a whole month once they got there okay and so the robber barons the most rich people and you know the Rockefellers all of us sort of going there and then they started doing druidic and Germanic rituals and reportedly even human sacrifice there and then kids started disappearing in the area it was being imported you know over hundred years ago the kids were missing hmm quite a bit they were missing children seem to be the threat pettite of narrative yeah so it seems like children or innocence the fuel so there's like a miniature sexy Netflix thing that's excellent they literally take the innocent death wing and they they suck its energy you say the new wood the new Dark Crystal mojo is an allegory of exactly what they're doing and so so I got contacted by a reporter with channel 4 and he said I've got people that work there and they want it to be exposed but we can't have the liability and I know you've snuck into some places that's an investigative reporting on some military drills that were practicing around people up and stuff we've you know we got your ticket and got you you know the inside deal you still get arrested by the Secret Service because presidents people go there but will you sneak in and I said yes so you were prompted by a like a facility or a group yes and it turns out who was this group again turns out it was the Democrats basically because Bohemian Grove Bohemian Grove is mainly Republicans okay and so I'm like I mean I'm 45 now this was in 2000 I mean I was a lot younger okay and I later learned I was I was set up so instead of getting into the occult part of it let me hit this first so I sneak in I get in there secret service questions we have been given pass codes so what club I'm in but still they act suspicious so I climb under one of these houses log cabins until it gets dark I'm supposed to be there on July 15th to catch the cremation of care a mock human sacrifice of a child in front of this giant owl it also doubles as a giant bull Molech where they sacrifice kids an entire in the middle Asian so so that our represents the sacrifice of children yes well and also the same owl that is present in Adult Swim say now that is present even in ovo for Drake in his record label but that owl you saying whether it is knowingly unbeknownst to the person who uses it it represents the sacrifice of children well it any symbol could have multiple uses but it is in the National Press Club symbol and the press has also gone there secretly so it's part of them being compromised and yes the reason they worship the owl in that particular form because it gave me nothing and Greek mythology knowledge and things like that is that the owl is a bird of prey America is a bald eagle and you know Iran is an eagle and you know everybody likes Eagles okay it's up there conceived it's it's smart it you know but you can't see it the Owls the rain oh now it's bigger than the bald eagle until one I mean it's it's metered hell it's got big old eyes and it can see in the dark so see it's got knowledge it can see you like special forces but you can't see it well you're in the dark it walks right over and just grabs you and eats you you can't do it a I'm thinking it kills other birds it kills Eagles at night the Eagles get down that nest at night they fear the allottee owls come in they hunt other other royal birds you would call them so so so these are the great terrain with it what kind of terrain would it be where an owl would hunt Eagle a place just like those redwoods so so it's the ultimate predator but nobody's got the owl as their as it's a national symbol so in the Bohemian and the Bohemian Grove is where Isles Hunt Eagles place all terrain sand so it's all a play on that like a we're the real bird again the only we only operate them so you think this American bird is the birds you need to be looking at for but in actuality is really this way yeah it's a our national birds Millia great or now twice the size of a bald eagle and I mean have you ever seen one what did you see when you broke in let me tell you something here you know awesome we've got these great horned owls you got in there too you'll be walking sometimes in the woods you look over at the edge and there's one sitting up the top of tree up out of the brush just look at it it's kind of like that big yellow eyes yeah it looks like that man it's scary now anyways it's one scary things you ever sees when you look over you feel looking you look over there's that great horned owl those big only alive but that's what you saw well they've got a 50-foot tall stone one and they bring a child to it and then they have the priest all out in front of it as you see it bring it's do you see a child they brought a child in effigy and I saw that yeah I in out I crawled out but then later I learned what happened wait a minute so you actually heat out you looked and you saw a child be brought to a 50-foot statue of an owl well they said it was a mock child but yes they said it was a month child but the thing is they put all their troubles on the child and then the deity and at that time Walter Cronkite was still alive he did the voice submit but but Theater all comes from rituals so theater the priests will get up and do theater as part of the rituals so we're in the church out under the redwoods around this little pond there in front of it it was people who broke in with you no no there's all the the members are watching but you say we you said we were no no we're all there I'm there with the people watching it and it's you're in hiding no I've come out at night I get in during the day they questioned me it's still three hours till night I cover it all my film dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove it's free online there's another one called order of death that that has the latest and again people can find it all free they've tried to take it off YouTube so you snuck into Bohemian Grove you were basically caught and questioned and allow to stay to witness a ritual I was about to say I didn't you're really smart or did you do your homework because I I didn't do my I didn't understand this till later okay so yes I'm given a passcode all right I think we'll the Secret Service questions me mm-hmm that I acted confidently just let me do it but the truth was they were just going through a checking everybody and they had the head sheriff there and they were looking at me and they let me go I climb up underneath a log cabin wait till it gets dark starting to get dark I come out there all feasting under these giant redwood tree feasting what do you mean we'll be there they're all a big huge picnic tables under giant redwoods like a cathedral but woody like printer at any national park you've seen I don't know that mean they're out there eating steaks whatever I'm not getting down there with them I come down out of the hills I didn't see what they were eating did you know that they weren't eating chewed no no no no this is all art title this is only the first gate because they bring thousands of guests to this about a thousand members I bring about a thousand yes 2,700 square acres but let me expand on that in the size of a fucking capital city yeah and so and so it's a mock human sacrifice they say mock human well and I'll describe that so me wait a minute who who would find it necessary to mock a human sacrifice well sure yeah mock has that well meaning as well but a mock means simulated okay who would have it useful to them and beneficial to there's a mock-up to simulate well they're doing it to see is the guest they brought are into it but the members the members are really getting off on it going while they do it and then they bring in a Hearst they bring in AAT so that must mean that they bring they bring back and draw on a black wagon with it with a child in a coffin okay live-chat they don't know it I was I was 150 yards away okay in the woods watching this with with the people down below me but were you 150 yards away in the woods this is like a devil worshiper movie where the kids climb over the hill and watch a human sacrifice I understand so this really happened I understand that's what she described it I'm just trying to clarify for my own understanding listen so you're saying you 150 yards away hiding in the woods watching a mock sacrifice yes of simulating a simulated sacrifice of a child and a black wagon brought in in in in a in a casket all right I understand that part now what I'm trying to say is earlier you said you were questioned yes okay so you said you were questioned before the Sun went down okay so if your question before the Sun went down how did you end up being 150 yards away in the woods still wise good question I mean I made the film there's two films they're free online dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove remember this is something a little hidden camera you know it's color back I don't know there but I got you here so I off the field there we go I go up to the end of the road they've got checkpoints and guards mm-hmm they've got a parking area right off here there's like a little swamp right here where they have these open back trucks that come and pick people up that work there and take them in or take members I crawl through I sit there and act like I'm in a car wait till some of these old men start going to get on the back of this flat back deal they we go rolling through I'm dressed like a yuppie they let me get in then I get off I start walking up the hill and I had a map that down here was the water and where the Moloch was the owl my luck's also a bullet has little meanings I go up in the hills I'm trying to you know get away from folks the will you pursued I want to tell you they're there uh some some some some some Hispanic gentlemen ride by on a Cushman work card they whistle at me and they say oh yeah they start laughing going you know there's one of the you know there's one of the prostitutes I was like you know 27 years old I'm saying is listen they didn't pursue you for being a bogey they didn't know they didn't know I get in I get out I see some guys happen whistle at me okay dessert at you in the wilderness no no no it's it's roads these give these woods so you get in you get past the checkpoint down here is where they basically like hiding behind a stop sign no I'm just walking like I own the place walk huge walk by and whistle at me and tell me they wanna have sex with me it's very gay okay okay I get up at the top of the hill okay a sheriff these sheriff a little earner walks up with Secret Service and they say who are you with I said I'm here with the what was the I'm here with the hillbillies and that's actually the camp of the group of the bushes I forgot his accent they go really I know yeah so I go on up all of a sudden I got a little side road I see a police car drop by I say I better hide I climb up underneath nobody one of these log cabins and I wait till it starts getting dark okay okay then I get another tape in my little DV cam little deal my little fanny pack that's you which is super obvious and then I sneak down I'm going down this nest stylish enough no gay men right listen I'm going down the hill I'm going down the hill and then I'm going down the hill and there they are down there with all these big tables there's photos this online that they've since released it's all eating food under the redwoods I go down here I get in position in the woods they all start leaving they go around they go around look at me they go around and get around the the the pool okay the pool is in like a like a pool of swimming pool no it's a joke it's not artificial I mean it's like a pond or lake right there okay it's like a long reflecting pool in front of the owl alright I kind of hang out people are already there waiting on the edge is it a fountain no it's a pool there's bats flying around grabbing bugs absolutely tons of bats so there's all these bats flying around eating bugs it's beautiful night the sun's almost down it's a beautiful night with tons of bats flying around if you go up in the Northern California there's a ton of bats in the summer flat around Edinburg if you look Austin there's like millions of them okay there's just bats everywhere continuous so there's a little there called Mexican brown bats that's a species there's all these Mexican brown bats flying around and Magno species is because Austin has a record number of as well that's what you live in the southern part of United States in the West and we're sitting there and this is what the with state this is Northern California okay say listen Toma County okay you can go there on July 15th to be a bunch of protesters oh no what guess what a pass well and I'll tell you a story I'm walking by and I never really told I've told this once but I don't like promoting the stuff just from either sighs all right Danny Glover's there oh shit and he's talking to folks and everything and then I'm walking by to go down when they're breaking up from the from the meal to go down to the pool right oh the owl said and I hear some old men look about 98mm call him going what's that guy leaping and we're doing here so actually did hear that while I was there and Danny Glover heard them no no I'm like I'm crying to like not be seen here and there's Danny Glover and then it was Bill Clinton's top advisor later I saw him well most powerful guys in DC Jordan whatever his name was there those launch of black guys I saw em and the dirty Glover was there an actor and I heard yeah and I heard just I was like that's any glove I'm trying to not be seen him in the crowd he's all racist stuff there but you still saw black people did so really saw art racism even exists in like Satanism yes I mean I'm just telling you I'm lying within Satanism I'm like they're standing I'm like saying there's gaining that shit to me is bewildering even if we have all come together to agreed to worship a dark being by the name of Satan even if we've come to do all of these things there is still a dividing class and people still will call me a nigger we can't just all be Satan worshippers you know what I'm saying I think I don't think Danny Glover I still am I not in a superficial extraterrestrial outside of my human form being when I become so I'm still considered a nigger even well Jim I only told that because I mean I get knowing you're being targeted and then one day it pointed out so people stopped doing it right I'm just getting the fact that I only brought that up because it's true and that was something that happened I mean I appreciate you bringing it up because it provides a certain level of insight but I listen I don't want to surrender Danny Glover no we were not slandering Danny no you're not because you're not even saying that he's there I'm gonna take it as though you look like any lover and who looked like dad but I want to be clear I looked it up later yes but let me tell you when I grand new charlton heston he went he wasn't bad and I also loved you know of course one of the greatest actors of all time Clint Eastwood Clint Eastwood is a member what I'm trying to explain is what is the purpose of the group it's all thinly veiled it's started by Mark Twain but what's their mission those do they get all the top actors and they get the top musicians the Grateful Dead is played there and a lot of them aren't getting what this ritual is it's a Faustian German death cult ritual mask what's their mission statement they're their mission statement is weaving spiders come down here and forget about the cares of the world and do basically a voodoo ritual but don't say that from Africa that's just a common term of where you put something on to something else like these have spirit senators in Old Europe and in England where they have somebody where somebody died you put a piece of bread on their stomach and a senator would come and believe that they ate some of the sins and take some of the bad mojo that's basically the same as voodoo and so they do voodoo there and it's a ritual where you put all your cares on to this child that you give the idol and they take it very seriously but the way it was described to me is a lot of people to go to its place to party hang out talk about stuff not everybody's having sex with dudes you know there's a bunch of female that I'm sure yeah I'm sure if you want simplicity if you care about pussy you can get too well don't they keep the women in a whole bunch of nice little hotels literally at the end of the street so about 400 yards like the women aren't invited says no no Janet yeah about 400 times you got to leave the Richards like go back and get you simplicity there's a golf course and there's about ten little motels and man you walk in there they got jets Lana from all over the world that done all the top hookers and porn stars are there yeah they're all just 400 yards away sort of messy why weren't you arrested I am NOT confessing here because I didn't know they're still yours later I'm gonna tell you you you saw it that I'm not kissing your ass man I'm impressed because I don't unless you've heard me tell this before did you know that I've explained that I was Senate oh shit I heard no okay I'm impressed all right I only figured this out years later okay there's a really nasty dude named Jon Ronson I should even give him attention or people you know he's nasty I'm like I don't know like like if you're entering a harbor you know they put a buoy where there's rocks I believe his name out no no II do what you want the guy that acts with this fake little liberal loving guy from England and all this stuff yeah he's the guy that I'm there covering our everybody got murdered at Waco and I'm there at 60 minutes is covering it this is like in 1998 he comes at me goes Alex have you heard of Bohemian Grove where they do rituals and all this and I said I don't believe all that stuff Bank and I didn't believe that he goes no Alex I'm with world of 1 to channel 4 and I know a lawyer in the town and they think you're the one that could blow it wide open others have been arrested let me give you a file he gives with this file always color copies of magazines and articles for 30 years and all the arrested CBS flying helicopters over nobody can get in and so he says one of the being a year but that's like two years oh good I'll pay you and I'll get you in and I know the workers are gonna help you so one side but then he tells me you've got to sign a dream italic so sure that I'm going to sneak in after you if you're successful but I'll get sued because I'm with the big broadcaster you've got to videotape it and give it to me and promise to never tell that's all I kept do me so I guess what we call cap well what's captain can you say cat what does cap cap see ap yeah cap is basically when someone is either lying to get you off of figuring their bullshit out or exaggerating the truth in an excessive manner that is cap that's what I feel like what he told you as you described would be well I didn't figure it out till later cuz I was like I don't know I'm 45 now I'm mm how old was I mean I was like I was like 25 26 oh okay so I'm going in there and I looked on the radio like four five years that time and I was I mean and and so they knew I'd snuck on some military bases and and done some stuff and so they they knew I'd gotten footage and so I go in there but he comes in behind me with the lawyer who it turns out was with the group so this was some weird revelation of the method but later I thought it was them letting me in it wasn't they got really pissed turned out Harry Shearer you know a famous comedian and actor he was somehow involved with Ronson and they believe they can only make a movie about it and and other things once they had gotten footage but they wanted to use me as the puppet cute or or the drone or the decoy to go in and get it so I go in I get the footage I get it to him they put it out all over the world it's a big hit and three years later I get calls he's on c-span with Brian lamb saying Alex wasn't the one that snuck in he I'm the one that did it so then he's on coast to coast to him that night Mel show we think he was there as well no he was there he was he made me sign an agreement that he was gonna pay me to fly there give me the contacts and get me in with workers there but really it was people involved in managing it but not the members it was Democrats in the locals trying to set up the Republicans hoping I would get dirt on the Democrats behind or what should probably mi6 so I mean the British mi6 was the difference in Hemet so mi6 is the British and that's the British CIA yeah yeah okay cool so the British CIA and the repented and the Democrats they were behind all this that is I know it was a setup but I mean come what you think so so and this is a guy that you don't wrote all those movies like many stare at goats and a whole bunch of other stuff but the point is is that he's a disinformation operative so I go in he says I'll try to get in later with the lawyer and I'm able later that night after I get out he comes out and says no I was there - do you have the footage I'm like yes okay there's just blown away that it's happening all the rest of it and I later thought oh they they knew I was going in and the Secret Service just let me but no I was given real Pascoe's on the people inside that wanted me to get the footage for another faction if I exposed this other arm of the cult where they basically Epstein takes you to an island to compromise you in weird sex and stuff they were taking people to believe me and Grove to compromise them who weren't in the cult yet so it's basically like a cult feeder okay and so what made me mad about this individual was he made me swear to never say he went in or that I had a deal to get in the footage from the beginning and then when it became so famous he got mad and was like I made Alex Jones I made him so famous which was even true but it did may be even more famous it exploded he then turned around and said I really snuck in and got it all Alex Jones didn't and just basically burned me on that TV show and that radio show I called in to coast to coast am with George Noory this is like in 2000 and my god it's gotta be 13 years you know that was 2004 2003 times before I forget yeah mm three or four you can go find that original Coast coast am no one and it's hard tell stories there's so much to go over but nothing he was on the show saying the same thing but I knew the show so I called the producers said let me on he starts apologize and once I get on air with him okay and said oh yeah Alex actually I did pay you to go in there and but he was telling the world that I was a liar and that and that and that he had gone and got in the footage what it's clearly me in the videos and me getting it all guess what the fact that he admitted that on camera in this document it works to you advantage to sure I just don't think like that like a snake and he's the guy that didn't did this fake NPR story that I beat up all these nerds in high school in Dallas and then they they kidnapped me and tie me up and knock my teeth that's what the book the the the the moral of the story is he's not here well store always a goddamn liar but he's not here on on expeditiously yeah you are I'm Stan and why are you here I want to know let me ask you that when Isis questioned you guys come on so do you think the Bohemian Grove let me in or I think I mean he obviously got me in but it was another group a separate group that was one in dirt on the Republican because they kept asking me to try to get dirt on you know I'm not defending the Republicans I'm exposing but you're asking me to kind of form it well you smelled it out that I was let in which I think I was I mean I think that it had to be a reason that you know I'm sure they have security I'm sure they have cameras already have infrared you know all kinds of shit that would detect even kind of heat-seeking night-vision gone to shit and I'm sure they had motherfuckers riding around on a TV look I'm sure that shit is just as secure as the border so what was the point I can't you have way more you have far more experience on the subject I mean seriously I was I was 25 I'd be far I'd be remiss to even try to guess but it took me that was that was 19 years ago it took me 10 years even figure it out that than that I would that I was used well I mean listen far be it for me to say what is it is because some other fuckers were saying that you were allowed to leave because you agreed to do their dirty work after you left oh no I never I never did I didn't that that's what I say I would say okay well if I broke into here and I was caught and I was questioned if I was allowed to stay if I wasn't apprehended then I kind of agreed to be a Fed no I thought I was legitimately sneaking in there and I never figured out between talking about you sneaking in we talking about how you got out I mean I walked right out the front that's what I'm saying if anybody else was to sneak in somewhere and get caught I don't think they walk out but you see that's the thing if I'm working for them I don't even know it well that makes a lot of sense too that makes no sense if it wasn't what I just said it could have been that you would not really expect it to be there in the first place but I tell you but expanding on there could go back and forth about that all day we don't really know the answer to it because you if you can't tell me the answer I damn sure can't eat all I know is he had pass codes into it and I got the footage for him so they wouldn't get sued and then he turned around later and then tried to change the story but it was stupid cuz everybody saw the footage right so it was just bizarre I don't know I know that he had contacts with not just the lawyer was security okay well and so yes they somebody in that organization let me in and let me get back out and people were always saying that did you really sneak in there cuz if they let you in did you really sneak in they I mean they have arrested other people they questioned me I had the passcode that's what I'm telling you so so you knew you had a pass code before you snuck in yeah no he said we've got this lawyer that works there so you knew you weren't really sneaking in you probably could have walked straight through the front gate with the passcode no no it was it was if you got questions so but if you walk through the front gate and get questioned and you give them this passcode they grant you entry but they didn't question me at the gate but you bypassed the gate because you should never seen yes but there was another gate another you driving through this so you made it through one gate and then you didn't make it through another gate is that what you're saying no they we just rolled through the next game okay there's footage of all this I know because when you tell me you're smoking it that tells me I did not I did not attempt in any form of granted entry that's nothing over/under sure I'm the one telling you that I think they let me in you're convinced you're convincing yourself of what I just I know but you know they let you in no I do not know your stuff an hour later when I say you it is a like philosophical you not you personally but one would one would know they have been let in if they cross yes they came and recruited me through an operative of but I'm not sure what's great when you actually made your way onto the grounds if you made your way on to the ground through a gate a security protected gate that would tell me yeah you been letting well let me go further there's another chapter you didn't sneak in then Brad were lady then Brad Metzler welcome what will our met sir he has you know that he writes his best-selling books he's got a show on History Channel over a decade later they say we want you to go back to Bohemian Grove oh you went back wait it was on History Channel I was a discovery and and it gets crazier he's crazier we're there at this old theater in the town right there and they've got the original alien from the movie aliens there and the guys wearing a CIA hat who's the director of the show and they're doing this big program I swear to god he said they have the alien from the movie alien is this like the real guy you saying that wasn't that wasn't see I got eight-foot rubber suit ok but you sure it was a rubber suit no they told me you're sure I don't know but you can't believe what it was really obviously this was on TV he put up details so whoa he was walking and talking he was a human on the wall what do you think of this and he pulls back the curtain ok ok ok ok people are all really creepy well wait a minute they had a full bar downstairs I feel like he was testing you to find out if you were creeped out by the 8-foot supposedly PLAs I'm scared now it could have been a fucking carcass well listen let you could have been an alien carcass let's go further so then they're shooting all day with me in there alright and then I go downstairs there's a full bar and the bartender starts threatening me he goes you know I played naked bongos George Herbert Walker Bush there and you're saying we're satanic I say fu is the whole town's run by him it's a cult and so they're actually people who live there and work there and they all love it anyway so he goes he goes I know you're speaking in what's the population of this town I don't know it's it's uh it's on the Russia level below 10,000 it's below 10,000 okay it's very it's on the Russian River so this guy says to me okay he goes you know I know you're sneaking in there again today mmm-hmm is that good call them and have you arrested but I'm not and then I noticed the directors laughing at me so all of a sudden I get in these canoes with their camera crew and it said if you get in canoes yeah instead of going in the front gate I swear to god it's all true there's all video of it and instead of go on the front gate they want me to go up to the back end of it where I've shot video before from this overlooking point okay when I went up that hill and hid out when I came back out I shot down and so they keep going and I'm the only supposed to show me where I went how they can go up yeah and and and all of a sudden they go no Alex you've got to go come on come on and I went no I'm staying below the waterline I'm not violating this place I'm not gonna violate and trespass twice and as soon as I start walking back they go freeze police and guys start running out with guns I go fuck you I run jump into the fucking canoe run from them and don't get shit no listen listen they start chasing me they don't shoot they got cars across the other side don't I jump off and swim with my cell phone out call my crew members to come pick me up alright okay this is this happen no gunner that's putting the show no good now another show they had me running from the police right and the security yes they all get arrested but let out the next day right and when I saw those please no because they're all friends with the bushes I'd already knew this right okay this guy writes books with the bushes I knew what it was okay they were literally this time right I guess pissed at the other group whatever group that is in the Illuminati and wanted to bust me okay but correct me if I'm wrong now that's my life I guess where I got you but correct me if I'm wrong still no gunshot no okay but here's the difference that is the quintessential definition a white privilege because cuz hey my motherfucking ass got cold anywhere near there at the bar at the gate in the canoe no no the bar was is an old theater in town the bars on theater in town I don't give a damn where I was when you said that they did when you said that that that bartender had kind of snarled at you oh he told me I've that motherfucking bartender would a bust off caps at me man that shit would have been you know what I'm telling you is is that I mean I knew do you never knew that wide net sir whatever famous works with George W you but it was all a big joke yeah I understand yeah yeah yeah I and I appreciate you for that insight because most of us my people would not have the opportunity to even you know you know YouTube's gonna do yeah I want viewers to do this please okay so I'm not allowed to be on YouTube go find go find the Bohemian Grove special from history or discovery or whatever it is well somebody type in Alex Jones Brad Matt sir mysteries or whatever and he did shows with the bushes but what I'm gonna do huh what you won't do what you want to people to do I want them to take everything I've said here for this and like you don't find the footage you put it to it I'm not making this up and somebody can find that old theater will be actual it's funny you trust me they go pick this shit apart because we think it mean that alien it's funny you said that I'm not just kissing your ass well now look at that thing I remember I remember Otto didn't take a photo I do have a foot on the phone somewhere I remember the alien from the movie yeah "
Jeffrey Epstein he just committed suicide talk about killing who was tied to Trump and acquaintance and the Clintons a bunch of other people bunch of them all the fuck is a billionaire a pedophile I'll bet man for so long have you ever cross paths with them hell no no no I don't think so but it's funny though like for the longest you hear this stuff sound it's so outlandish from like Epstein so even if shit were like pizza gate and Haiti you know you hear like man there's no that's it it's so dark there's no way it can be true and I would be reading this stuff and be like something like again I'll be like I'm not that much of a conspiracy theorist to be like that this stuff they can't really be trafficking little kids and sleeping with I mean that's that's been and still be billionaires and I'm like this is truly Babylon if this is the case and so I would never speak out about it too much because I didn't want people are you talking about like there's no way let fucking Pizza game in all that is shit and when you step back and you start Pizza gay it's not a real thing I mean but from Epstein with Oliver gate was that what a little bit the Clintons were trafficking like underage kids through a kapitza restaurant they had nothing to do with nothing some guy actually showed up there with a gun and got arrested and if somebody tells you about the Epstein shit and you'd be like man come on now this billionaire is really taking and what cuz I don't want to fuck it up but someone that worked for him even on the Child Protective Services side was actually snatching those kids that were supposed to be missing kids and providing them to like that that shit in itself sells fucking ridiculous well you know what's even crazier is that he was on suicide watch right he kills himself while on suicide all right and apparently no cameras captured it on top of that that doesn't come on out and I'm not big on conspiracy theories right here somebody get the Scooby Snacks that's right the Mystery Machine yo clearly he has information about a lot of motherfuckers yeah and David wanted him to die with that information now he's dead and he's a billionaire right like a few times over like let's not act like like he wasn't one of the cast that was supposed to be touchable so when you hear about this type of stuff going on in in our society on the elite aspect well I would not believe all that it's others I didn't want to believe I had heard about that shit the same way I'm like man I don't have no true proof and I'm still I'm focused on the community I only want to uplift and speak positive so when I would hear shit like that and I couldn't tangibly understand it it just sounded like another one of those conspiracy theories and for that to actually be truly and you make you step back buddy well fuck what else is real about this shit listen you're a pedophiles out there point-blank period some man Manik some men are pedophiles they're into underaged girls and boys sometimes both and having a lot of money to a certain degree so I said access to access I always say and uh you know my thing is like this case had been going to five ten years the fact that he was still in America kind of blows my mind because you would think he would just go somewhere else where he thought he was untouchable yeah well you got touched how do you good he thought he could pay it off yeah and I bet you he was paying it off for a while until you pissed somebody off and as I we going we're gonna sacrifice you well our kill he's currently locked up remember we've been talking about this for a while now since our last interview he actually got locked up right no bond still different cities catching cases there's no catching cases I remember someone posted a meme and had this dude like looking pissed off and the caption was when you won when you've won the jail talent show two years in a row our killer shows these go he's gonna win the talent show they got my man Bill Cosby in their holding court yeah I mean like I mean his was it you know any pedophilia but it's just as dark and it's like shit man what do what are we supposed to say about the people that were placed in front of us in such a positive light that have all of these dark demons this is just no longer an environment where you could really hide what you do which is beautiful you fucking love this motivates you to be a better person it's called a paradigm shift even to the point you know what's crazy I remember like I remember I was getting into conversation with someone and I mentioned I forgot what it was like let's just say I mentioned the Bowflex or something yeah the Bowflex workout all right and I look out my phone and there's a Bowflex ad and so I'm like these folds are definitely listening to you yeah yeah I'm a hundred percent sure of this I've seen it happen time and time again these phones are listening to you imagine all the shit that you say to yourself like man what kill this motherfucker bow recorded said to the media sent to authority center whatever like no I was just talking to myself doesn't matter you just admitted to wanting to murder somebody I love like I love it because it allows you to to be your truthful self even if you don't want to like your Bible says what goes on in darkness will come to light like I truly believe that there's you got to operate in the life man and and everything that's dark is gonna come forth and we're gonna have to deal with it in these harsh ways that we dealing like that's why like mad at Donald Trump because he's bringing all of that darkness to the forefront and and we got to deal with it as a nation and how we deal with it is gonna show the importance of our humanity 
you take the red pill and i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes crow man but when the hitting hit i might milly rock to get up off it in the new days with my always that there's something wrong with the world you don't know what it is but it's there according to entertainment television in response to little nasdaq's latest video you see this is very scary for me people will be angry they will say i'm pushing an agenda but the truth is i am he is admitting he is pushing an agenda he is an influencer of the youth this agenda is targeting our children his presence and actions are a pre-planned movement his initial release of all town road soared to number one on the billboard 100 for 19 weeks becoming the first song in history to remain that long at the top mainstream entertainment heavily promoted his song as suitable for children old town road has become very familiar with the youth i saw you first does your mom tell you after mentioning boobies in all time i'm here to promote my little book c is for country i'm just out here you know my kids now have grown very attached to your book you know majority of that success i would like a tribute to kids his song was even used as lullabies for children and i actually sing a version of the lullaby song to my daughter she loves it she just goes ape crazy every time i play it this boy having a tool to old town row she was shocked because daniel has autism and is mostly non-verbal i mean it took us six months to teach him the letter a and without being taught are you telling me he's humming this song it's music that's how we reach him that's how we teach him the power of music isn't that something yeah and three of chalet's poor children have autism but daniel has not progressed like the other kids with therapy so this music and what is happening with him and repeating those lyrics is a really big deal repeating those lyrics is a really big deal what kind of message are the lyrics truly promoting it's a message of break the rules and do what is pleasing to you it is the same deeply satanic philosophy held by countless other prominent performers the do what you wilt philosophy by aleister crowley this meeting just begun i'm satan's son this satanic philosophy heavily impacts children don't even flip me off finger back where it belongs the power of music it's not just about breaking the rules but little naz's videos progressively condition his viewers which many are children into the occult his latest video perverts many biblical references it pushes agendas what has this world come to it's come to a world where drag kids actually exist and people do ketamine on a couch and one of which is pure satanism where little naz proceeds to give satan a highly graphic lap dance that none of us need to see and it wraps up with him taking over satan's dominion to top it all off he releases satan's shoes complete with satanic pentagrams and a drop of human blood mixed with dye with only 666 available they all sold out in under a minute the boxart contains an incredible level of satanic detail and of course luke 10 18 i saw satan fall like lightning from heaven luke 10 18 has been touched upon previously in my videos with countless artists obsession with lightning symbolism he's flashing all the same symbolism previously covered including wearing a black and white tile masonic jacket and all seeing eye jackets and one of their favorites covering the right eye and in my opinion it really is just an artist's way of expressing himself is this really all just art when he explicitly stated that he has an agenda is this really just soul art when they are using all the same symbolism and it just happens to be satanic symbolism watch my video innocent arts or packed with satan that thoroughly breaks down whether the quote-unquote art we are continually exposed to is innocent or is there something more sinister behind it not only that this video and my latest video sports contract with satan discloses what all this symbolism means check them out soon before more of my videos are taken down by youtube what were you doing last year last year i was i was on my i was at my sister's house i was sleeping on my sister's floor so how did a little nas really get to the status he is now a year later from sleeping on your sister's floor you had the number one first history making number one song for 16 weeks in a row 19 weeks in a row he came into the position he is now the same way countless other artists have i sold my soul to the i can't devil it no no i can't say no i made a bargain with it you know long time ago and i'm holding up my hand what was your bargain to get where uh i am now should i ask who you made the bargain with with with you know with the chief uh commander on this earth and this earth and then in the world we can't see i wanted to be like the amy grant of music yeah but it didn't work out and so i sold myself to the dev katy perry was originally a gospel singer but she was going nowhere with her career as she admits she sold her soul and started producing secular music with occultic symbolism and occultic messages with even her in hell with satanic themes and now she is highly successful it's the same story repeated over and over again in the music video can't feel my face by the weekend he is going nowhere with his music career until the devil literally lights him on fire this makes the crowds ready for him and his music satan is not a fairy tale he is very real satan the father of lies is running this world until judgment day he is going to bring as many people as possible to where he's going and he's targeting our children satan uses music artists actors actresses to initially appear innocent for the children to follow so what did you feel and what inspired you to come out at that time how it would be good for the youngins who listening to me right now and then those performers fall way off the beaten path into the occult in satanism taking the children down with them this has happened over and over again miley received her own pair of little naz's satan's shoes and disney is infamous for releasing films that appear innocent and are not and for releasing pure occultic films for your children to watch how it would be good for the youngins who listening to me right now little nastax is a pawn used by the true controlling entities of this world to test the waters to see a society is willing to accept blatant satanism and to see how close we are to accepting the coming antichrist they think you're some kind of god the man who returned from the dead the last days are indeed upon us this world isn't just moving in some haphazard and random direction it's running full steam ahead fulfilling saiyan's hands in the world in biblical prophecy saying is not a myth spiritual warfare is amping up your souls and your children's souls are at sake do you see the direction the world is heading and want answers to this the solution lies in the way the truth the life yeshua jesus our hope is in what lies ahead beyond this life for what is your life it is a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away however for all that repent which is whatever is hindering you from god whether it be sin or whatever you turn from that and you turn to him and believe on the lord jesus christ true belief is lived out in our daily lives yet the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not bless the light of the glorious gospel christ who is the image of god should shine onto them so do as christ has commanded go therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all the things whatsoever i have commanded you jesus asserts and why do you call me lord lord and do not do the things that i say if you love me you keep my commandments because eyes have not seen nor ears have heard nor has it come into the heart of man what god has prepared for those that love him the time is fulfilled the kingdom of god is at hands repent and believe the gospel second corinthians 2 11 declares for us not to be ignorant of satan's devices ephesians 5 11 asserts for us to expose evil so please share this documentary and the videos to come we must wake up people to the deception of this world before it is too late let's work together to overcome may the peace of god be with you and your family you 
what you're looking at here is over 300 scientific reports on fluoride's neurotoxicity both animal and human studies representing the work of literally hundreds of scientists from dozens of countries current exposures that u.s kids are getting uh are somewhere between five and ten times above what a safe level ought to be so it's it's a pretty good bet that that some u.s kids have suffered loss of iq points that they didn't have to lose as an ex uh president of the union and uh charter member of the union and a 27-year veteran of epa uh i could say that this is something the epa has got he's got to come to brits with now the stalling game is now over starting today you 
"almost everything that we make with hemp but they just refuse to because it's hot right now they don't have a full hole to just grab that microphone it's like what about the spit knowledge it's a cotton business someone sick conspiracy and happened one sentence you know I was like you know what I was like I was sitting here thinking damn this podcast has so much power you ever see those kim jeong-hoon videos of people worshipping him like he's a Beatle you have to have using no it's almost too ridiculous like they are chasing him through the streets and soldiers acting like little girls it's unbelievable yeah they literally have to man did you ever story is fascinating it's very fascinating how that like it's mind-boggling North Korea is it's amazing videos people worshipping him and then you watch there's documentaries of people going and they get inside and they and they're like constantly being guided through North Korea there's everything there's face wait a minute and most people think look they're so communist they're putting on this is like a yeah they're putting on a show it's obvious that they're good they're they're giving them a tour of the city but they're being guided the whole way through they got people on them and they're not allowed to do shit you see Shane Smith saying when he wants North Korea for the first thing you realize in North Korea is you're not a tourist you're on a tour you come in you're shown what you're shown you're escorted out you're escorted the whole time you're never allowed on your own you can't leave the hotel which is on an island until your guards come and get you you have a guard a guide and secret police the first time you eat in North Korea it's kind of a sign of the very weird things to come there's about 20 women who are getting ready for our dinner first of all they give you about three or four courses of absolutely inedible food it's just matter it's like fried matter and you're kind of going yeah but you're waiting for everyone to fill in when's this banquet happening when's the baguette there is no banquet where is everyone it's not very busy Hugh you realise they've gotten so much bad press for not having food that they want to show oh there's plenty of food food everywhere and they're carefully laying out the food the whole time you're eating and then you as you're leaving you notice they're pulling all the things that just carefully laid into little tiny trays that are carefully gonna bring back and keep for the next day and you're just sitting there by yourself eating your matter going okay I've come to crazy land so everyday around 6:30 in the morning our guides and our guards would come to pick us up to put us in a truck drive us out to some monument and you drive for like two hours and the first thing you notice are there's no cars the villagers have no electricity there's no nothing nothing's happening anywhere going down south from me again as you can see there's nobody on the roads at all there's no cars in the road we're at a tea shop right now and as you can see I'll be able to got here we're just sort of driving on lonely roads and lonely Petros and there'd be the tea girl who speaks English and has been waiting for you and he realized she's been waiting about six months for anyone to show up to sell her tea how are you this is and and she's just so excited you're there and you realized she hasn't seen anyone in 10 months this is gonna be another ten months before anyone comes Applause Applause Applause this is our Tea Room we gotta go orderly we had a good time it's so surreal there's nothing normal that happens ever in this whole country so most people are thinking man they're so communist or whatever or or that the the dictatorship is so strong there that look they won't even let people walk around freely you know it's like it just seems like it's dad what the fuck is going on I don't know I don't I don't think there's a conspiracy in the conspiracy I think maybe is this a double negative I say fucking I double cross oh he's oh they're testing missiles did you see that shit seen the parade shook the clip of the parade where they show them like the soldiers monster right and then their flags and then they bring out the missiles and then they'll cut the Jim Hong Wong or Jim Kim Jong hoon like there's a clip of like like they're like no no I kind of watch in and they're gonna and then they cut back to the parade and it's the same clip and then they go back to Kim Jun they just I don't know live it I think well here's what you have let me just before you go any further let me just explain this it's distractions do you stock footage when they have stories on these guys and they use it all the time where they don't have footage of the guy currently so they have a story about Kim jong-un they start talking about them and then they show stock footage that stock footage could be him DARPA is just was North Korea releases video I understand that's what it was like yeah well that's China China has more than China's and North Korea does to write out the border they have like fit to entice the people of the south to come to North Korea if they had a probably I think I think North Korea really needs to be looked into because you think it's fake weird I have to go to war hold on you think North Korea's for I'm not saying it's fake I'm saying that it's fake I'm just saying that Kim Jong gook could eat he might be part I think they're all buddies I think at the very top the top of Russia at the top of the United States the UK they're just putting on a show and he's designated villain when we need to distract people from this or that fucking he Kim Jong hoon testing testing missiles he's testing missiles he's you know he's gonna he's gonna fire off one but in China it's very possible that we've changed our foreign policy and that we're getting more aggressive with them and this is their response yeah and that they also are very incompetent because they're terrified they're what they are essentially is a military dictatorship they're terrified population and their science is shitty they don't have about getting all this from the media so we can't miss the truth but we're getting this from everywhere I can't always assume that everything for the mainstream media is not true because here's the deal if something does happen that's a real thing that happens the mainstream media is always going to cover it stop and listen to me here because this is important just because something is in the mainstream media and I know you distrust the mainstream media it doesn't mean that it's not true because you always have to realize that if something happens say like mount st. helens blows right lava lava flowing that Street bunch of people die that's a real natural disaster that we all know happens Fox News is going to cover that CNN is gonna cover that everybody's gonna cover that if North Korea does try to launch a missile and it does fail everyone's gonna cover that so just because CNN has something monitor Fox News has something on it doesn't mean that it's Felyne for sure I'm totally with you I'm just saying it looks watch TV on the show look into North Korea who's the king of conspiracy things I was Jones Alex Jones do you see him he's like yo I'll play I'm just playing a character man yeah real kids me too I would do it to house a but even he was like dude I'm just saying some shit to get mister gheylens belongs to a country club mr. Jones is an outstanding citizen and he is essentially just a really really popular Phil Henry he's a animate he was like I'm just put on performance man I don't believe that shit performance artist he says I don't believe that shit I'm just playing a character I don't believe that shit that's what I heard you working him right out I see what you're doing he's working you I'm just saying the Savior's like it's a performance I'm out well I'm just saying have fun no no no no you ever suing him that were going after him if you listen to him he's reading a statement like don't come after me never going after him we're trying to shut him down that's what's going on he totally knows that anyways he's watching his ass they're coming after seven anyways anyway all seven tower DC gates I get it catch meets again I'm just saying look into North Korea it's fucking hysterical - its hysterical I think I think I'm just playing looking into it but but Eddie this will there's like a door here Pentagon - testability North Korean missiles the video is the next video I played ok well listen man this is strange time the fact that here's here's what's strange the fact that these people are actually doing this the fact that you can get people to goose-step down the middle of the street and ride a tank and salute the king like this shit's all real they don't know what you better write if I find a video where they worship Him yeah that's the greatest shit but but listen this what we're looking at right here is actually happening this is not CGI no but so this is either two levels of weird it's either one level of weird where you have this populace that's so entranced by the the military dictatorship that they just act out every day of their lives like this and they can't help themselves or - this is all bullshit and these are all actors so they've got five million actors waving Korean flag you can see five million whatever the fuck it is you got people who's stepping let's do it there's a lot of people there I don't know how many thousand that is but there's a lot of people there they put our shows four people coming and you come in they're gonna put a show on for you but now everywhere you go they're putting on so there's actors everywhere already this is just a lot of them but they're already understand already act these people goose-stepping and doing all this think just the fact that they're able to do that say if this is all fake let's just let's just go to TV so let's go deep deep deep deep deep what are the odds that you're gonna get that many actors who don't even have Top Billing to stay in line what are the odds what are the that you're gonna get them to perform like that and drive tanks and keep their mouths shut and this was everyone pitching in it's way more likely that these people are under the thumb of a military dictatorship because none of people right because we've had a fuckload of military dictatorships in history but what we haven't had is a country filled with actors and who's playing these actors who's giving them that fucking who's the crazy money who's the god damn teacher and how would they train all of them where is this dressing is it one big auditorium using one episode of fame goose-stepping dude this is crazy look how many people there look how they turn their fucking tops over whatever they're doing that changes it for to the flag goes looks like a New Year's Eve parade look at these people man they're all marching - dude just the fact that they could get anybody to do it either either one there is regular businessmen right there on the side there's a few people that are probably just saying it looks fucking fishy no I'm running rampant I'm just saying me ask you this I'm saying let me ask you this mr. Sam what is more likely is it more likely these people are fucking terrified and like many many many other civilizations in the past like this right right it's never existed but I'm sure it has in China I'm sure it has an ancient ancient Japan should we know for sure we know my guys the Aztecs killed 80,000 people after they've cut and built one of their pyramids I mean he's probably legit but we've been lied to so much about like what's a lie do all these people are actors and they just live there they're all out under they love this let's think of how crazy that is wouldn't it be more likely that these poor people are just brainwashed because we know people get brainwashed craziest when you when you're taking into consideration all the lies that we've been told the faked moon missions and all this shit nothing I mean this is nothing they put together a bunch of people and made a fucking parade they fake the moon mission six time but everybody believes that shit but there are real events this is too convenient there's too much of a distraction Eddie this my guess is we're not going to war with Eddie this is my greatest productions this would be one of the greatest productions in the history the human race dude these are not fine find the people but don't say it's legit these people are these people that are stuck in North Korea people that have escaped have told horror story suppresses it's like a giant cult it's horrible it's like this is a fucking you know 10 million comments I'm not saying they're actors I'm just saying there's something fishy about the whole North Korea at the horse it's I'm just saying that there it could be anything I'm just saying I don't know I'm saying it smells fishy something is not right about what they're telling us about North Korea I don't know they're just small here's the real thing that's most fucked up about North Korea is that even if you freed them from this guy they've been under the thumb of a communist dictatorship for so long they wouldn't know what to do to institutionalize yes they really are it's like a guys heads up man do you know how many people would be so susceptible to some new form of dictatorship fuck man I mean you literally have a whole country that's they always do that in these these countries when they remove a dictator and then this is power vacuum and a way more horrible person takes their place you know like what the fuck man like they got rid of good fee and now it's just the crazy ice is strong yeah yeah Libya apparently man oh no too much about it but they were saying that it's a failed state at the Wild West with North Korea though they can't even date like that he controls their media TV like internet they can't log on to certain fucking sites some gonna get internet no there's no iPhone like you're being iPhones I got Danny from the future they still got flip phones and shit yeah they're they're living in a really weird country a hammer they flip I think I think the globalists like it I think we need villains and they can probably help him out and fund him I mean they like the shit he's doing they they need a distraction anything happens we bombed the testing missiles boom for two weeks are gonna be all over North Korea a couple months and then it's gonna be gone watch North this is like the new Ebola remember that was Ebola Ebola distraction distraction North Korea is perfect to distract that's was a distraction you don't think Ebola was a bunch of like really smart doctors stopping some shit before it got horrible because you got a hemorrhagic virus is escaping but people really got it just because a bunch of shit happens at the same time doesn't mean that one of those things that happens was a design to make sure you don't pay attention to other thing just cuz they dropped that mother of all bombs in Afghanistan did you see that she looked like three people killed 99 it ought to go through the ground they launched the biggest bomb ever created you know it's the heaviest most powerful bomb ever it's crazy when you watch this show you've seen it Jamie the blast radius is a mile looks like you're dropping a straight spaceship yeah and it killed at first I could kill 40 people goddamn some of our crazy mass shooters a forty women 90 fucking yeah you got it they gonna drop it I mean it hit and apparently devastated this tunnel system that they were having a hard time getting to because they said that Isis has this stronghold out there 21,000 pounds video of that from the Afghanistan hit yeah there is it's like a military video yeah I was expecting a little more out of it to be honest with you yeah it's um it's hard to tell what's going on because it's black and white white they paint that bitch Charger horns that bitch is no came from mark why'd they put fucking rate white racing stripes on it is a crazy little machine big a spot you're not buying that shit Eddie you know explosion no it's the biggest bomb that ever has been dropped okay in war outside of a nuclear bomb I'm trying to figure out what's the angle why are they showing us this that's what I'm thinking that's how crazy I am I'm fucking so down for anything I want to become when it comes to military shit that's blasted on the History Channel or CNN I'm automatically what's their angle I don't buy it let me ask you you need crazy sanity dinosaurs I'm crazy dinosaurs really not I don't trust that shit you know just David I love that Triceratops because everybody loves one two Triceratops fights the Tyrannosaurus Rex everybody's rooting for the tricep right if you're ruined for the Tyrannosaurus Rex in that epic battle there's a douchebag right right so you like what about woolly mammoth I I would say yes giant kangaroo that's what it is that's my guess it looks exactly the same it's got a tail hops around on two legs tyronn - that's a fucking they found a giant kangaroo and when they figured it out they go dude it's a kangaroo fuck well listen if it was a giant kangaroo would be just as impressive yeah hundred foot tall kangaroo you imagine fine how about that one Jack kangaroo he sent one Jack kangaroo that lives in a park somewhere Jack he's not that I Sally he's like the Kevin Randleman of kangaroos you ever seen this kangaroo yes so that guy who fought the kangaroo yeah the guy's an asshole what tough but here's my thing it's like a kangaroo was 100 feet tall but just as impressive as a lizard 200 feet tall tall crazy there Triceratops isn't a fucking looked like just a different kind of rhinoceros like it is I bet that kangaroo would fuck us up that's vitor belfort vein on his bicep that's like Mark Coleman in 95 there's a tank do you think the Hibiscus eat him up no man we're gonna run we're gonna get that Samurai Roy that fucking thing that's a scary animal it's a big fucking scary animal they killed your father they can get like seven feet tall they're fucking huge is that real yeah there's certain ones that are that's a real kangaroo it's so jacked well they're really there's two different kinds there's red kangaroos and grey kangaroos I don't know remember which ones the big one I think it's a red kangaroo the red sounds way more northerly what's the largest Google what's the largest kangaroo young Jamie I think it's I think it's 200 pound rip kangaroo clashes mine but you so Eddie what do you you don't think that like t-rexes are real do you really lose that when you look when you look into when dinosaur bones are first discovered I mean that says when you look into dot dot dot it wasn't just like all dinosaurs were discovered there was a time line there was a lotta there was a lot of fraudulent shit that was dude saying hey look what I found there's no bitch that's just the whale bone that I fuck he's ever getting paid there was a lot of fraud going on in the 1800s when they were discovering but was that what about like the way the earth is like the layers and can tell with certain time paid from the layers the Stratus well if you're talking about carbon dating there's a lot of science that goes back and forth I couldn't shit or it's real oh it's not much universally acknowledged the carbon dating is effective okay well not the stuff that I'm looking into chase your tail with this shit no I'm having fun figuring out how we're being bullshit it is very obsessed with it bullshit crazy I think we're being lied to about fucking everything your kid's gonna grow up just skeptical don't trust anything you see on TV I'm Martin we don't we let a little cartoons here here and there a little bit but Bob's corrupters but we I'm gonna raise him not trusting TV you know I don't give a fuck and you can't you can't say nobody would ever disagree with that the TV is not good for kids it's not good for kids why don't you have a show in the Alex Jones Channel what is how fucked my total retard on them I went full Flat Earth oh no no no no most most most conspiracy does most conspiracy theorists nah flat earth is the most retarded thing ever when Joe furnitures correct when Joe first brought it up like a body about a year year and a half ago he said dude he was trying to he was trying to basically say how stupid people are you said do you know people still believe the earth is flat and the Sun is 3,000 miles away and I remember sitting there thinking shit that were they Amish or something like how dumb do have to be again like maybe six months later and I and I said and I said on your podcast I said that's got it that is so dumb that's got to be some kind of CIA psyops I was in class and we were talking about conspiracy theories in my buddy Manny full-blown conspiracy he goes do you ever do you have my jiu-jitsu class we're talking about my YouTube class all those conspiracy class you go to school teaches I teach so Manny turns me because did he ever look into flatter this was like eight months ago and I said never look into astronomy yeah right when he said Danny did you rest fourth grade right when he said that Manny anybody drop you on your head - smokin I'll ah I can't believe anything that ever comes out of his mouth again Jesus please don't ever bring the ship you keep that shit dude - I'm telling you the story and then Jay and then Ernest comes up to me and goes hey man you ever looking to flatter Jews Jesus goddamn Christ okay sure and he goes hey man I got a master's in engineering look into it and I just wanted to go I just went home and I was just gonna about the matter what fuckin school that was we can tell people yeah Phoenix online I'm so crazy mmm I so don't believe you want something else to do yeah I I tried to try to debunk it I was trying to debunk it I wasn't there's a fucking Japanese satellite it takes a photo from 22,000 though even if the pixels those pictures it's from 22,000 miles away flip phone dude and you you're the front-facing cameras were always dog shit always you know on the back facing one it's pretty legit yeah that's how it works 22,000 miles away it's a hard to take home 7 seen a picture of the crazy thing I'm not saying it's flat I'm just a look into it I'm saying we don't know what the fuck room wait a minute satellite this Japanese satellite hold on Eddie this Japanese satellite that all these hundreds of scientists worked on the moon picture every 10 minutes and you can download it from the website CGI composites so constantly make it CGI and some sort of custom links some sort of a comment thanks why do you think you don't have the technology to make CGI that looks that good why don't they have the technology summer into space where's the pictures from NASA how come they don't have any they don't have that space kind of no they just never did it they don't get a fuck about proving it's around those pictures I've seen don't show me a ripping listen NASA does not have one of those satellites fake why does it look famous suck it looks like something you would see in a movie that's because when they do it in a move they try to make it look like this which is what looks real if that's real to you man you don't think it's real they faked not saying that because it's irrelevant we're not talking about to marry that's 1969 we're talking about 2017 it looks fake do you think there's some gigantic conspiracy involving the Japanese government where they put up a fake picture of the Earth from 22,000 miles up every 10 minutes a high-resolution downloadable photo you think it's fake why wouldn't it be do real what what isn't it just as likely that the Japanese actually did launch that thing in space why would it be fake propaganda man okay why would they care that it's there a photo of this flat earth no I don't like I just said again there's is there snow if there's no photo of of the Flat Earth from space there's no photo of the round earth that's true that's not you know those why do you say they're fake those well it's sake they look CGI but you're not an expert in imagery looks like to be an expert to know what you stars at the movies when you watch some ridiculous kung fu video being a martial arts expert if you were sitting next to someone who told you that their sensei can't compete in the UFC because they're too deadly wouldn't you get pissed off because you're an actual martial arts expert that's just like you with no science background whatsoever talking about a slow those crazy I'm crazy why not indulge on screen why not indulge the film realm of possibilities and not cling to the conspiracy every single time no no it's it's a NASA can't get picture they've been they've been doing CGI composites this whole forget about stating what NASA does please answer my questions why do you always go towards the conspiracy why do you never consider the possibility minimize but people it's all the same everybody it's a global thing yes all despite European Space Agency's lying all in on it it's a global thing so my things I think all governments most of them the globalist are all working together to to control their if they control you broke with the PP you wanna keep you on up there's I don't know man I don't know what it doesn't make sense what why just control points you could find the sound oh the realtor you put them on a ball because again I'm crazy you put them on a ball my guess is you're on a ball you're nowhere don't try to go anywhere just stay there and said you know what we got to release some fake map that shows that you can demonstrate that the earth is round we're Earth from space what is that we just looked at one Eddie stop saying it was fake you don't know that it's fake but you're saying look it's a real problem it's crazy don't say that stop just stop and think because you're communicating to millions of people just saying something that doesn't make any sense it does make so you don't know anything about imagery you don't know anything about what you know anything about that it looks fake to me come on you're just looking at it with the naked eye it looks real to everybody else in this room okay confirmation bias crazy right I don't think you make sure everything I'm just having fun with it but you have this don't direct inclination to always go towards a conspiracy that's what you think cool there's nothing that you're getting angry I'm not raising my voice what I'm trying to do is corner your ideas I'm trying to corner your ideas because you're saying these things to your very influential you saying these things to millions of people but I don't think you're thinking correct I'm telling I know that's why I've stated many times that you're crazy but here's my mind when you you said when do you think you started losing it I think I was you know as soon as I found out when I was 11 that everybody wasn't Catholic that was that's when I started losing my I'm like everybody's not Catholic I thought everybody was Catholic there's other religions and how do we know we're right there's a bunch of whit's a Jew oh shit there's more juice and catkin Catholics how do we know we have the right religion I'm like okay you saw the website yes that's when I started going that's so funny people that question authority are usually looked at as crazy conspiracy theories CIA there's a problem in the way you approach these things because you approach them all knowing before you even start that their conspiracy I'm telling you what I go by I'm telling you hey dude when you lie so much you gotta prove to me you lie so goddamn much I'm never gonna be saying the things that a defense but you would say I'm saying the thing that's what I'm saying but it's not a good analogy because it's filled with lies yeah government's the government's on being accused of lying they've been caught lying so they're there they're in court but he's already signed a government that's not the government Oh whoever whoever just ingest scientists it's all government scientists you think scientists you think there's these independent scientists come it's all government scientists they don't why would your grants are all they control you don't think you don't think the globalist aren't control haven't controlled the science and information since day one the globalists flat fuck these guys we just spent them like a day together I think you just fun hey I'm just having fun man I like finding trust from the government this idea of the government the government consists of a bunch of individual science agencies any fighting do you like to CIA FBI for each other of course there is there's no one govern there's a lot of personal shit going on in between of course it's not just personal shit there's a bunch of different factions that you call the government I had the idea that it's really the government can't be trusted I just say that because I'm not gonna I mean I you want me to pick out some agencies NASA I could pick out some sudden air stuck-up but just in general in general its history science education energy everything has always been controlled by the government since day one radio has been used as propaganda since the day it was invented you think some independent dude just invented radio and then he started broadcasting there like his favorite music and shit and he what his thoughts no it was the government from day one and radio it was the government in all countries from day one in TV in the movies it was it was all radio TV and the movies you have always been about propaganda always in every country it's nothing new it's old-school gangsters art countries the Moses's have considered what does this have to do with the world being no no this is this this is this is how gangster are our government is there's a there was a war on drugs we started war on drugs turns out we're bringing it in then there's a war on terrorism turns out we created al-qaeda do you understand why I'm crazy I'm crazy because of that shit like you could believe that shit you want to believe that you just apply this to everything basically anything anything coming from the government dinosaurs don't come from the government just there's so much fraud when you look into it look into it but I have looked into it look kid look this is you could you could go over these different sections of the earth look at the next one that comes 10 minutes later maybe you won't think that one's fake oh wow that one's kind of all fake it doesn't look fake to me it looks like what the fucking earth probably looks like when you're 22,000 miles away to you it does not to me NASA's disagree yeah but why think that it does because I don't try I think the government does make these fake pictures of the earth don't you think that you want to speculate I mean I could sure it's easier to control people when they're on a ball I've been trying to tell people that forever I don't know like we got to live on a ball I taught it to my wife is to be easy to get the kids to listen I've just lived on ball that doesn't even make any sense why would it be easier to get people to listen if they're on a ball rather than their fun a plate because if there's more land people gonna want to work there's actually more land shit what do you mean it's more land who knows if you if you exactly that's what are you talking about understand what you're talking about like more you're saying if the world is flat and the Flat Earth model is true okay what's the point of it what's the point of so all the math is fake like that the earth is going 24 hours in a circle is that all fake that spins a thousand miles an hour I don't do it stationary albums booze there's if you do the experiments if you look into the experiments to prove that the earth is spinning all of them failed look into it"
hello I'm making this video because I want to show you the glory of the power chords that I rely on to power my cellphone and my headphones that only half work one earbud doesn't even work I don't know why don't just cut it maybe I will and the back cover of the book what to do oh no it's really the emotional incest syndrome what to do when a parent's love rules your life everything everywhere happens for a reason everything there's a rhyme and a reason to everything and art is everywhere Paul McCartney has passed from the earth and now lives in the spirit world the band The Beatles was a tool that the Tavistock Institute used to engineer society the nice young men from Manchester England who took the world by storm was presented in contrast to the not-so-nice young men the Rolling Stones and given the choice many gravitated towards the Beatles not knowing that as the Beatles fell into drugs and helped to form the counterculture and you know free love that in choosing this band that would fall from grace they slowly lost their hold on the truths of existence the truth that there is a God the truth that a human being a man or a woman can stand in their own power and attract good into their lives that you can commit a loving act and you are rewarded that all you really have to do in life is trust your Creator and do good be perfect as your heavenly parent is perfect Paul McCartney was replaced with a freemason who was groomed for the job you can see the difference in the facial structure a lot of latex was used some plastic surgery and they created a new Paul McCartney Paul McCartney was as far as people could tell beheaded in a traffic accident and then in the 1960s it was somewhere around there Paul McCartney pass to the spirit world the man who replaced him was placed in the leadership role of this band and although people speculated about it no one knew for sure and that's part of the trickery that's part of the usurpation you present information and you present a counter to that information that acts to confuse you and in your confusion you are manipulated so the freemasons are up to no good you know many people say that the people on the lower levels of Freemason aren't such bad people they don't know what they're doing um there's one problem with that and although I agree with that to a large degree the making of an oath to a group of people and even if it seems like a joke saying that I will never divulge of the secrets of this organization making an oath to anyone that should you break that oath harm will befall yourself or others is sinful in fact joining an organization that revels in secrecy is sinful why would you be attracted to such an organization why would you be wowed and moved by ridiculous some symbology if you want symbols look to the world around you look to the symbols inherent in your physical form look to the form of nature the form of animals trees birds look to the physical laws that God has created and what they represent these people in Freemasonry have it as their core belief that we exist in duality we do not exist in duality that is ridiculous it is a ridiculous notion to suggest that we exist in duality the only do allottee that exists is one that we've created for ourselves the only do ality that exists is exists in false creation which is not of God you look at your body look at your physical form it works you look at how you take an action to move forward in a direction and you attract good things unto yourself you attract success look at the birds and the mammals and the reptiles and the sky and the atmosphere and the water in the air water vapor and rain and lighting storms and the food chain and the plentiful abundance that is all around there is nothing dual about that a lot of people will say well you have men and women they're opposites how are they opposites how is a woman opposite to a man God created human beings and and gave them the gift of love and a way to express their law physically that way is the sex act the sex act is a beautiful act it's a beautiful expression of love there's nothing dual about it there's nothing a posts opposing about it there's nothing opposite about it it's not opposite it works together as it happens God also made homosexual souls who still can enjoy lovemaking they do it in a different way woman to woman man to man but it's still of God and when you achieve higher levels you will see that their love is just as real as the bond in the heterosexual soul and if you don't believe me that's fine but at some point you will see the truth but there's nothing opposite in this universe that God created God is a loving being God is our parent God loves us and desires our enrichment and knows that the best way that we can be enriched is by our own freewill choice God made it that way the only opposition we find is our own resistance to the truth our own desire not to act the forces that may be in any form in any capacity that you may deem holds you from greater joy greater fortune untold vistas of surprise and excitement and fascination all those forces have no power over you they have zero power over you you as a soul have agency the only power that anyone has over you is the power that you give them it's a simple idea there are people who have decided that it is best to form an organization that might provide themselves with some means of exerting a more permanent I'm looking for my word here a more permanent hold on the world and their means and methods are flawed because what is not loving is always a flawed course although they have some power it's only due to the power that human beings every man and woman in the world gives to them and they also have the power that spirits in the spirit world who have passed on whose interests remain on the earth to their own detriment I might add but they have the assistance of these dark spirits who have yet to come to the truth who have yet to desire the beautiful life-giving love of God who have yet to realize that God can be their only master they have decided to assist these wrongdoers and it is to your detriment to assume that there is no spirit world there is no life after death atheism is your only recourse it is to your detriment that you would accept such nonsense the spirit world is real spirit influence is real and it matters so that's really all I have to say in this video I hope you've enjoyed 
"Sometimes there's a glitch in the matrix where the limitations of the old operating system are laid bare and something new pokes through They've been dozens of responses to the jordan peterson channel for interview already. What makes this one different? Well, I have a pretty unique perspective in October last year I went to Toronto to interview Jordan Peterson at his home you came in from where I came in from London last night, I turned the interview into the first full-length documentary about Jordan Peterson's ideas I Was pretty sure he'd soon become a lot more famous and be recognized as one of the most significant public thinkers but I couldn't possibly have predicted how he'd break through to a mass audience a few weeks later Peterson did an interview with journalist Kathy Newman on Channel four News in the UK a Program I worked on as a reporter and producer for ten years It was a sensation Millions watched it online Tens of thousands commented an overwhelming majority felt Peterson had been unfairly represented And in the week since it hasn't stopped Peterson has been asked about it constantly on the most high-profile online shows 12 rules for life so without reading this So what you're saying is There's only 12 things you need to do in life right, that's it well yeah this This interview that you just did with this woman Kathy Newman shit was that in the UK it was Channel 4 UK so what does this glitch say about the state of mainstream media and the culture at large By diagnosis of what's actually happening is that people are moving further and further away from? what is what thinking actually is I'm at or more into merely running a script and What does Jordan Peterson actually think that's so controversial you are? misrepresented more than anyone I know in a weird way. You are villainized in a weird way where I can't believe that these people are honestly looking at your opinions and Coming up with these conclusions. I believe this encounter struck such a nerve because it's a cultural watershed moment But seen properly as Peterson would say it's archetypal in that it contains layers and layers of meaning That go right to the heart of the biggest rift. We're seeing playing out in the culture Over the next 50 minutes. I'm gonna do my best to unpack it From the clash between new and old media. There's also why YouTube is gonna kill TV Because television by its nature all of these narrow broadcast technologies they rely on forcing the story all the way down to the mythological an Archetypal level I thought of ideologies as fragmentary mythologies That's where they get their archetypal and psychological power, but in the postmodern world and this seems to be something that's increasingly Seeping out into the culture at large you have nothing but the tyrannical father nothing But the destructive force of masculine consciousness and nothing, but the benevolent Benevolent great mother and it's a it's an appalling ideology, and it seems to me that it's sucking the vitality Which is exactly what you'd expect symbolically It's sucking the vitality of her culture and to ask how do we move forward constructively rather than just adding to the polarization? I've been a journalist for 16 years in the newsrooms of the BBC in channel 4 and then making documentaries I moved away from the frontline of news some time ago and started learning psychology Which is what first drew me to Jordan Peterson? from a distance I've started to see the blind spots of the establishment media much more clearly I Spent some of the best years of my working life at Channel 4 News and have a huge amount of respect And gratitude to the program But I'm making this film because I feel so strongly that if we can't have open conversations about the kind of topics Peterson is raising We're in serious trouble My book went up to number two and on amazon.com in the US the next day right it's number one in Canada it's number three in the UK all on Amazon I Couldn't have asked for more publicity right and so I could also be sitting back and saying well. You know she tried to My a person who regarded herself as my ideological opponent Tried to go after my philosophy and my reputation on national TV Failed brutally and has been taken apart for it. It's like This is a good day, but I don't regard it as a good day. I don't think it's a good day I think that it's evidence of the Instability of the times that we're in it would have been much better For me and for everyone else if what we would have had was a real conversation You said that it's actually a sign of the times where things could go really wrong for all of us really soon Yeah, we're playing with fire. Yeah, what do you mean by this? Can you can you elaborate? Well things go wrong in cultures all the time right you get you get the polarization Increases until people start to act it out Peterson is one of a new breed of thinkers made famous almost completely by the internet not the broadcast media Part of a powerful new informal network being called the intellectual dark web The mainstream media is based on an old dying model that is being replaced by new media And new technology so quickly that its faults are becoming glaringly obvious Fortunately, thanks to YouTube podcasting and however else you get shows like this one the mainstream media's stranglehold on information Which really is a stranglehold on your ability to think clearly about the issues of the day is crumbling at an incredible rate? Now the question is who and what will replace it a few months ago one of my favorite people to sit across this table from Eric Weinstein came up with the phrase Intellectual dark web to describe this eclectic mix of people from Sam Harris to Ben Shapiro to his brother Brett Weinstein to jordan Peterson all of whom are figuring out ways to have the important and often dangerous Conversations that are completely ignored by the mainstream It's why I would argue that this collection of people are actually more influential at this point than whatever collection of cable news pundits you can come up with If you think I'm being hyperbolic about the growing influence of this group just check the traction that these people get on Twitter or Facebook Compared to our mainstream competitors twitter may not be real life as I say in my Twitter bio But it is some barometer of what the zeitgeist is right now what unites this group of thinkers is a sense that the set of ideas that have run Western culture for years are breaking down and That the chaos of the moment is the attempt to find new ones It's nearly all happening online part of the problem that we have right now in our culture is Trying to diagnose the level at which the discussion should be taking place And I think the reason that this is a tumultuous time is because it actually is a time for discussion of first principles and it's that first principles are Virtually at the level of theology because the first principles are the things that you assume and then move forwards like well What should we assume well the dignity of the human soul let's start with that you can't treat yourself properly without assuming that you Have a relationship with another person you can't stabilize your family You can't have a functional society, so what does it mean for this human soul to have dignity? well The part of the idea is that you're participating in Creation itself and you do that with your actions in your language And you get to decide whether you're tilting the world a bit more towards heaven or a bit more towards hell And that's actually what you're doing so that's a place where the literal and the metaphorical truth comes together and people are very They're terrified of that idea as they should be because it's a massive responsibility They also argue that the central problem is polarization boosted by social media Peterson's work looks at how people are hard-wired to see the world differently a lot of what determines your political orientation is Biological temperament far more than people realize so for example left-leaning people liberals, let's say although that's kind of MIS misnomer, but We'll keep with the terminology liberals are high in a trait called openness, which is one of the big five personality traits And it's associated with interest in abstraction and interest in aesthetics it's the best predictor of liberal political leaning and they're low in trait conscientiousness, which is dutifulness and and Orderliness in particular whereas the Conservatives are the opposite? They're high in conscientiousness They're dutiful and orderly and they're low in openness and that makes them really good managers and administers ministers and often businessman But not very good entrepreneurs Because the entrepreneurs are almost all drawn from the liberal types and so These are really fundamental fundamentally biologically predicated differences, and they're you might think about them as different sets of Opportunities and limitations, and and certainly different ways of screening the world and Each of those different temperamental types needs the other type Let's call this a diversity issue if you start understanding that the person that you're talking to who doesn't share your political views isn't Stupid that's the first thing necessarily. They might be but so might you be no stupid. He isn't the Differences in intelligence are not the prime determinant of differences in political belief All right so you might be talking to someone who's More conscientious and less creative than you if you're if you happen to be a liberal But that doesn't mean that that person's perspective is not valid And it doesn't mean that they wouldn't outperform you in some domains because they would so one thing to remember is People actually do see the world differently. It's not merely that they that they're possessed of love ilie informed opinions the whole point of the dava democracy is to Continue the dialogue between people of different Temperamental types so that we don't move so far to the right that everything becomes encapsulated and stone and doesn't move or so far to the left and everything dissolves in a kind of Mealy-mouthed chaos and the only way that you can you can navigate between those two Shoals is by is through discussion, which is why free speech is such an important value It's the thing that keeps the temperamental types from being at each other's throats in The aftermath of the Trump election that came as such a shock to most of the media One of the most widely shared analysis pieces was from deep code It describes how the establishment mainstream media perspective based around liberal values of openness and inclusivity He calls the blue church is being challenged by a new web-based insurgency a red religion based on the values of tribalism The culture were the the 20th century was a decisive success for blue any effectively a route for red So what we see first is that red was forced to move into a deeply exploratory phase Second that it did this in a context Where as it turns out? things were changing meaningfully quite significantly in fact it from my perspective in a world historical level the emergence of entirely new forms of communication and therefore entirely new sense-making and coherence He concludes that the blue church is in the process of collapse as its dominant ideology Can't adapt to changing reality But that a combination of the two sets of values of blue and red is essential we are conscious and Effective in the world in groups, not as individuals and the ingredients of those groups Include aspects that are currently showing up as both red and blue I Propose somewhat strongly that Neither red nor blue as pure Elements contain the ingredients necessary to actually be adaptive to reality This is a disaster in fact It's a little bit like Separating the hand and the eye Now you're the eye can see if the eye takes itself as being the essence of virtue it separates itself from the ability to do The same thing with the hand for most of human history these groups have actually always commingled They're necessary that they actually relate to each other in a deeply healthy and direct fashion their separations into armed camps is Extinction area actually you know the values of red that you think blue needs to integrate you also may also reintegrate. Oh well That's actually pretty easy Responsibility I mean we've actually even seen it The ability to Make a commitment and keep it Which which by the way ideologically shows up is either duty or loyalty, but those are both ideologies the the deeper sense is that ability Responsibility both of the individual in the group level the ability to actually really make a Personal sacrifice on the part of the group that's actually a deeply read value and I don't mean that by the way as Politically ideological certainly there are people who? Are currently part of blue who feel that deeply what I'm saying is that that shows up much much more intensely in Read and when you're feeling it in blue. You're actually feeling a red value, and that's good mixing is crucial Because that's very Jordan Peterson esque - How would you how do you define Jordan Peterson? Or do you think the fact the issue is that he is is not definable within one of those two camps Yeah, I think that's the point I think that he grasps directly the fact that human beings can only actually make sense of the world by virtue of communication with other human beings and this is all about the notion of admixture that one must have a mixture of of What I mean he uses the mythopoetic to make sense the order order and chaos The way right the taoist way is the alchemical admixture of order and chaos And that's it like that's how you do it, and so if you bias towards orderliness You find yourself in a rigid non adaptive non creative non exploratory framework Which will die because the world changes if you bias towards chaos You you eat your young and evaporate Which also ties for obvious reasons? And the key is to actually enable these things to be in relationship with each other and vital healthy relationship with each other, and I think that's in some sense the essence of what he's Focusing on and instead of the core what he's asking about Peterson is hard for the broadcast media to get a handle on Because the depth of his thought means he doesn't fit easily into any of their categories The clash with Kathy Newman was his breakthrough a moment where the new world met the old To give the context from Kathy Newman side she has to do dozens of interviews each month Peterson is hard to get a grip on and he sure as hell looks controversial She's also focused on getting sound bites for a five minute cut down of the interview for TV. Not a long conversation for online The interview was ridiculous. It was a ridiculous interviewing. I listen to it or watched it several times I was like this is so strange It's like her determination to turn into a conflict - it's one of the issues that I have with Television shows yeah, because they have a very limited amount of time, and they're trying to make things as salacious as possible They wouldn't have these sound bites these clickbait sound bites And she just went into it incredibly confrontational not trying to find your actual perspective But trying to force you to defend a non non realistic perspective. Yes well I was that I was the hypothetical villain of her imagination essentially. No this is also. Why YouTube is gonna kill TV Because television by its nature all of these narrow broadcast technologies they rely on forcing the story right because It has to happen now It has to happen in like often in five minutes because they only broadcast five minutes of that in interview They did put the whole thing up on YouTube to their credit It it it hasn't ceased to amaze me yet. I think that they thought that the interview went fine after the interview Channel four News found themselves at the center of an online storm Which included some nasty personal and misogynistic attacks? It's understandable that they just wanted it to go away But online is forever and as the center of gravity continues to shift away from traditional media this interview is I would argue a slow-motion and Continuing car crash for Channel 4's credibility, so why did it happen? Partly the limitations of the medium of TV, but also because of the institutional political blindness of the mainstream media I've always considered myself of the liberal left, but especially since the election of Trump I've been trying to understand what happened and I'm convinced that the polarization We're seeing is mainly driven by the shadow side of liberalism in particular where supposedly Inclusive social justice liberalism stops being inclusive and secretly judges and despises people that don't think the same way the rebellion of Trump and brexit was a direct response as Yuri Harris argues in this article in Colet the new gatekeepers of the media have become a new bourgeoisie Enforcing a rigid etiquette and using the rights of the oppressed as an excuse to put forward a vision of the kind of society they personally want to live in on the surface level it's about how a narrow social justice worldview embodied by Kathy Newman in the interview became the new status quo and How this institutional bias of much of the mainstream media? Means it can't see or understand the forces that are challenging this new consensus The counterculture used to be on the left, but once it won. The culture war it left space for a new counterculture The biggest manifestation is the red pill phenomena which the mainstream media? Mistakenly assumes is the same thing as the OLT right? I was surprised to just discover the overlap between What I minute II particularly like Greek philosophy and stoicism and The alt-right who I've always thought of you know if I come across on the tour. I thought the most kind Swivel-eyed bogeymen you know completely unpalatable extremists in their in their basements and then to discover that You know a lot of them were a lot of people in stoicism were also really into the alt-right Made me wonder. What was going on and why? People like me were getting radicalized I'm drawn into if you explain. What stoicism is for Stoicism is basically an ancient Greek philosophy, which was became very popular in the Roman Empire You know with like the Emperor Marcus Aurelius was a stoic for example? And it's in some ways like a Western form of Buddhism It's like a therapy for the emotions it teaches you to take Responsibility for your thoughts to take and thereby to take some control over your emotions so in some ways it's putting forward a model of strength and integrity and kind of resilience Amid adversity and rapid change so for that reason it's become very popular in the last 10 years I Think this is also. Why from my perspective at least someone like Jordan Pederson Is often looked from the outside as being aligned with the alt-right because he has a similar message But it's but there are crucial differences. I think between what we would consider I mean certainly white nationalism would be an essential part of the alt-right I would say of any useful definition, and yeah, that's that's certainly not characteristic of of Jordan Peterson from my experience No, there's a crucial difference at least between stoicism and the alt-right Even though a lot of alt writers into stoicism in that stoicism, and and maybe Jordan Peterson as well I don't know. I'm not an expert on him talk about the way to gain strength and maturity and power is Internal it's to take responsibility for your own thoughts and feelings Whilst I think people sometimes men might look for that sense of power and control externally by suppressing or Segregating anyone who they feel threatened by whether that's other colours or other sexualities or Gender so there's a crucial difference there one is about kind of inner Integrity and and and just kind of being strong within yourself and the other is about trying to take control through the kind of exterior I Mean every public appearance that I've made that's related to the sort of topics that were discussing is overwhelmingly men It's like it's like eighty-five to ninety percent And so I thought wow that's weird like what the hell's going on here exactly, and then the other thing. I've noticed is that? I've been talking a lot to the crowds that I've been talking to not about rights But about responsibility right because you can't have the bloody converse. What are you doing? You can't have the conversation about rights without the conversation about responsibility because your rights are my Responsibility that's what they are Technically, so you just can't have only half of that discussion, and we're only having half that discussion the question is well What the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion and the answer is what you're leaving out Responsibility and then the question is well What are you leaving out if you're leaving out responsibility and the answer might be well, maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life That's what it looks like to me. It's like here you are Suffering away, what makes it worthwhile, right? You know you're completely. Oh, you're completely you have no idea what you're You it's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is responsibility That's what gives life meaning It's like lift a load Then you can tolerate yourself right because look at your useless Easily hurt easily killed. Why should you have any self-respect? That's the story of the fall Pick something up and carry it pick make it heavy enough so that you can think yeah well Useless as I am at least I could move that from there to there well What's really cool about that is that when I talk to these crowds about this the man's eyes light and that's very good I've seen that phenomena because I've been talking about this Mythological material for a long time and I can see when I'm watching crowds people you know their eyebrows lift their eyes let light up Because I put something together for them. That's what mythological stories. Do so I'm not taking responsibility for that That's what the stories do so I say the story and people go click click click You know in their eyes light up, but this responsibility thing That's a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that. It is unbelievable. It just blows me away It's like really that's what's that's the counterculture? Grow the hell up and do something useful really I could do that oh I'm so excited by that idea no one ever mentioned that before it's like rights rights rights rights Jesus It's it's it's appalling. It's and and I feel that that's deeply felt by the people who are who are coming out to To listen to these sorts of things to they're they've had enough of that So and they better have because it's it's a non-productive mode of being responsibility man Peterson is part of the counterculture that he describes himself as a classic liberal and yet he's frequently Described as right-wing by the media This is not limited to Peterson James d'amours infamous Google memo was described everywhere as an anti diversity screed Despite him specifically stating he wanted to encourage more diversity in the workplace Many believe that the Channel 4 interview was a significant moment in exposing this mindset as dogmatic reactionary and fixed so during the interview we see an example of a Delusional framework that is what appears to be largely incapable of perceiving and reacting to reality in real time but much more interesting is what happened afterwards which was the sort of the self-healing and policing mechanism of the larger social consensus of how when how the blue church Reactively goes about maintaining the integrity of its frame And so what ended up happened was there was a break in the frame there was a glitch in the matrix the Mechanisms of the blue church reacted to endeavor to control the frame and to convert it into a way of sense of Making sense of the what occurred that still maintained the integrity of its frame? Do you mean when they tried to characterize it as sort of? abusive trolls and you're right hero, and all of that exactly exactly it's sort of a to use of a military language it was a fallback position that was a Reactive almost instinctual and not almost in fact precisely instinct was that pure habit there was no Thoughtfulness or even strategic Action there it was if if X then Y and in this case Y is. Here's a set of things that one does to re-establish the dominant frame and Now we're now were two levels deep you know the first. Level was a sort of self-evident disaster, but then the second level was also a relatively self-evident disaster and There isn't really a third level In this approach so it ends up happening, and this is again. You can kind of just think about this from ordinary psychology This is how? delusions fall apart As try as we might our desire to interpret reality to mean what we wanted to mean at the end of the day. We'll always Be checked against what reality actually is It may be some time. You know we're pretty good at making things up and pretending, but eventually Reality is reality this isn't to say that Peterson is not controversial He's saying things that challenge the most deeply held assumptions of the new establishment narrative I guess the other reason that people are on My case to some degree is because I have made a strong case which I think is fully documented by the scientific literature that there Are intrinsic differences say between men and women and I think the evidence and that this is the thing that staggered me is that? No serious scientists have debated that for like four decades It's that argument was done by the time. I went to graduate school everyone knew that human beings were not a blank slate that biological forces not Parameterised the way that we thought and and felt and acted and and and valued everyone knew that the fact that this has become somehow debatable again is just Especially because it's being done by legislative Fiat. They're forcing it Part of Peterson's argument based on years of psychological research is that much of the political? Conflicts are due to try to integrate the different political temperaments of men and women we were talking about the relatively the relative evolutionary roles of men and women this is speculative obviously and and Because our research did indicate. It's tentative research so far that that the the the SG is SJW sort of equality above all else philosophy is more prevalent among women It's predicted by the personality factors that are more common among women so agreeable this and high negative emotion Primarily agreeableness, but in addition. It's also predicted by being female and so I've been thinking about that a lot because well men are bailing out of the humanities like mad and Pretty much out of the university is except for stem the women are moving in like mad And they're also moving into the political sphere like mad, and this is new right we've never had this happen before and we do know know do not know what the Significance of it is it's only 50 years old and so we were thinking about this and so I don't know what you think about this proposition, but imagine that that that historically speaking, it's something like Women were responsible for distribution and men were responsible for production Something like that and maybe maybe that's only the case really in the tight confines of the immediate family But that doesn't matter because that's most of the evolutionary landscape for human beings anyways what the women does did was make sure that everybody Got enough okay, and that seems to me to be one of the things that's driving at least in part the SJW demand for for equity and Equality it's like let's make sure everybody has enough. It's like look fair enough You know I mean you can't you can't argue with that but there's there's an antipathy between that and The the reality of differential productivity you know because people really do differ in their productivity I think that the SJW phenomena is different and I think it is associated at least in part with the rise of women to political power and and We don't know what women are like when they have political power because they've never had it I mean there's been queens obviously and that sort of thing there's been female authority figures and females have Wielded far more power historically than feminists generally like to admit, but this is a different thing And we don't know what what a truly female political philosophy would be like, but it might be Especially if it's not been well examined And it isn't very sophisticated conceptually it could easily be let's make sure things you've distributed equally. Well, yeah Why One of Peterson's main influences is the psychologist Carl Jung Young psychology was built around the concept of the shadow all the things about ourselves. We don't want to accept our anger negativity Unconscious judgments, and how we need to integrate all those disowned parts to grow I'm convinced. That's what's happening on a vast cultural level since leaving channel 4 news I've retrained as a counselor and started leading personal growth workshops for men And thought a lot about how these unconscious gender dynamics are playing out in the culture One of the central concepts is Jung's idea of animus and anima possession How each have both an inner masculine and feminine essence in? A man when he's unconsciously possessed by his feminine side his anima he becomes withdrawn Moody and reactive and when a woman is possessed by her male side the animus she becomes aggressive and dominating and How many women are pushed into that by the nature of the modern workplace? The Kathy Newman I know is warm compassionate a successful and talented journalist none of this is criticism of her Just the role she was playing in the interview I would say technically and this is might be interesting for people who are interested in union psychology If you want to understand what Carl Jung meant by animus possession which is a very difficult concept? Then that that interview was a textbook case of having a discussion with someone who is animus possessed life has been moving forward for three and a half billion years and It moves forward in these pattered and manners like the dominance hierarchy for example, so that's that let's call that the masculine archetype It's part of the masculine archetype in fact the onus Proclamation was that the female representation of the male so that's the animus is the Dominance hierarchy it's the patriarchy So that's that that's the unconscious archetype, which I think is extremely interesting given what's happened say in the women's movement because that's what's projected onto men and and It can be projected in a very negative way it doesn't have to be but it can be and so an animus possessed woman treats a man as if he's the Manifestation of the tyrannical patriarchy he's a group he's that group of men Yeah, the group of bad men actually you watched the Jordan Peterson Kathy Newman entity. What did he what did he think I? My whole body contracted, and I I felt so sad for womanhood I felt disappointed and I Could see how the shadow part of womanhood was acting out I could see how the collective rage was acting through Kathy Newman and This is what happens is that when that's unknown its projected blindly on to Whatever stick wherever it sticks and it was very clear that she already had an agenda and she already had a projection that she was just Looking to state she was she was just looking to have that confirmed so I felt on behalf of women I felt sad and disappointed because we need to have intelligent conversations, and I also want to say that this isn't even though the the specific example is the Kathy Newman Jordan Peterson interview, it's not specific to - Kathy Newman I think the fact that that interview has resonated with so many people that it's been so popular shows that actually something archetypal was going on in that in that interaction And I think as well why it's gone viral is a lot of people watching it Recognize those dynamics. They're like I've been in conversations like that I've been in this conversation where nothing I say works where nothing I say gets through So there's something sort of fundamental about about the masculine feminine dynamic. That's going on in there What do you think that is I think Jordan Peterson? He's everyman Kathy Newman She's every woman I can tap into that rage like this I know it in myself and women that say they don't they're just denying it because it is in the collective So in that sense it just highlighted what what's that? It's wonderful because here we really get to look at why is this so? Important why is it so important to listen to? To a thinker like Jordan Peterson and take it seriously and say what can we do with it? It's just so obvious that it's needed Because if this is where we are if this is where society and cultures is if this is the ability to have an intelligent conversations Conversation then we are in trouble, I really feel that there is this collective subconscious rage that is just boiling in women and it's coming up in so many ways we see we see in the media and What's going on is this? unknown Rage that comes up in in many different ways um And on one hand it needs to come out we need to clear it it needs to be expressed it needs to Be acknowledged on the other hand it's not enough. This is only like this is breaking the ice So that the next step of evolution, can you know? Consciousness can start coming through and that's what I'm lacking in women. It's really to take responsibility for what we do as women in our Manipulation in our seduction in our control, and and it's so easy for women to say but that's just because we angry and men did this and patriarchy, but it's It's such a lack of responsibility and this Women really need to know I mean, that's the the kind of shadow work is The acceptance that we all have shadows that men certainly have a shadow. There is a shadow around masculinity but there's also a shadow around femininity and while part of the cultural conversation now is toxic masculinity and everyone knows what you mean by toxic toxic masculinity if You talk about toxic femininity Everyone still knows what you mean, but you can't have that conversation Which is it's it's interesting? What is allowed to be said and what is not allowed to be said at the moment and that that I think is? is very Dangerous that certain topics certain conversations are off are off-limits And this is where we see where we see the victim persecutor dynamics activates it because women become the become the victims, and we make ourselves the victims and we Persecute men but in that aggression in that rage and when we are the victims. We are in perfect control we become the persecutors because we say It's all about blame Men did this and men need to take responsibility But in that we become the persecutors, and it's also very difficult as well because one imagines that that Combative attitude is something that has served her well in the past and it's something that She's maybe felt forced into because of the nature of the society that she's operating in so it's a kind of catch-22 situation for the many successful women because they feel that they're pushed to be more masculine and Then when they're more masculine they get judged for being more masculine It's it's very sad and and and I can see that dynamics being played out absolutely But I think the only thing we can do is to take responsibility okay? I'm doing that do I really want to compromise my femininity do I want to compromise my integrity? Do I want to compromise my gender and? Play that or is there another way that I can be powerful without being aggressive without playing a power game But resting in my natural power resting in my natural dignity Resting in that deep rootedness that we both have in our genders that When we are peace with it and when we acknowledge it in ourselves It's there as a natural thing and and this is the thing I don't want to make this personal about Kathy Newman Because it's it's in that potential is in every woman, but it's because we are persecuting our own femininity What's being played out that we're doing it to ourselves because we don't trust that it's good enough to be a woman We don't trust that we can have conversations that come from a felt embodied perspective. We don't trust that we're connected to truth because these these Masculine ways have been have been very strong and women have been denying their own power In my work over many years of working with this I find that very few women Grew up in households which really? Loved admired respected honored cherished the feminine and So there is intrinsically for so many women who've grown up in the I don't know the last hundred years that say A kind of devaluation of the feminine that gets taken on and of course and as well as abuse aggression all sorts of things so very Many women out of an intelligent strategy to survive Develop their masculine side as a defense against that devaluation for the feminine and over time they become very Identified with that masculine side the male equivalent is animal possession in anima possession it's the loss of relaxed confidence in the Groundedness in the masculine and is overwhelmed by his own inner feminine side a passive withdrawn moody bitchy Complaining not showing up kind of guy, which I think is really so much what feminists are angry about I Don't see them as really angry about the masculine per se but it the way that Males behave, and you know I have got a lot of compassion for that Because for myself and most men that I know we weren't really shown how to be as men We didn't really get initiated into it and so and then this strong thing comes from feminism And we feel like it's it's maleness. That's wrong, and it's not it's not maleness. That's wrong. I don't even think feminism feminists hate The masculine it's like what the call is really for men is to develop their masculine strength presence courage be relaxed and confident be protective and be strong and Under this kind of assault which has come from a lot of animus possessed women a lot of men have retreated And I think gone into feeling guilty about being men and have become passive Indecisive and in that way a kind of feminized man has emerged Those who followed Peterson's thought recognize his analysis goes all the way down to the bedrock to the Archetypal structures of consciousness itself the thing that I really see happening and you can tell me what you think about this in annoyance book Consciousness which is masculine symbolically masculine for a variety of reasons is is viewed as rising up? against the countervailing force of tragedy from an underlying Feminine symbolically feminine unconsciousness right and it's something that can always be pulled back into that unconsciousness That would be the microcosm of that would be the Freudian eatable mother Familial dynamic where the mother is so over Protective and all-encompassing that she interferes with the development of the competence not only of her sons But also of her daughter of her children in general, and it seems to me that that's the dynamic That's being played out in our Society right now is that there's this and it's it's related in some way that I don't understand to this to this Insistence that all forms of masculine Authority are nothing, but tyrannical power so the symbolic representation is tyrannical father with no appreciation for the benevolent father and benevolent mother with no appreciation whatsoever for the tyrannical mother right and that's that and Because I thought of ideologies as fragmentary mythologies That's where they get their archetypal and psychological power right and so in a balanced representation you have the terrible mother and the Great Mother as Anointment laid out so nicely and you have the terrible father and the great father So that's the fact that culture mangles you have to death well It's also promoting you and developing you you have to see that as balanced, and then you have the heroic and adversarial individual But in the postmodern world and this seems to be something that's increasingly Seeping out into the culture at large you have nothing but the tyrannical father nothing But the destructive force of masculine consciousness and nothing, but the benevolent Benevolent great mother and it's a it's an appalling ideology, and it seems to me that it's sucking the vitality Which is exactly what you would expect symbolically, it's sucking the vitality of our culture you see that with the increasing demolition of of young men And not only young men in terms of their academic performance Which like they're falling way behind in elementary school way behind in junior high and bailing out of the universities like mad and so And I well the public school education it's become completely permeated by this kind of my anti male propaganda I mean, and I need to mean public schools are just a form of imprisonment. You know right now They're particularly destructive to young men who have a lot of physical energy You know you know I identify as transgender gay mic myself way But I do not I do not require the entire world To alter itself okay to fit my particular the self-image I do believe in The power of hormones I believe that men exist and women exist and they are biologically different. I think that I think there is no cure for the culture eles right now except if men start standing opera in demanding that they be Respected as men here's the problem You know this is something my wife is pointed out to she said well men are gonna have to stand up for themselves But here's the problem. I know how to stand up to a man who's Who's? unfairly Trespassing against me and the reason I know that is because the parameters for my resistance are quite well-defined Which is we talk? We argue? We push and then it becomes physical? Right like if we move beyond the boundaries of civil discourse We know what the next step is ok, that's forbidden in in discourse with women So I don't know like it seems to me that it isn't men that have to stand up and say enough of this even though That is what they should do it seems to me that it's saying women Who have to stand up against their crazy sisters and say look enough of that enough man-hating enough? Pathology enough bringing disgrace on us as a gender but the problem there And then I'll stop my little tirade is that most of the women. I know who are saying are busy doing same things, right? They're off they have their career. They have their family They're quite occupied And they don't seem to have the time or maybe even the interest to go after their their crazy harpy sisters And so I don't see any regulating force for that that terrible femininity, and it seems to me to be Invading the culture and undermining the the masculine power of the culture in a way, that's I think fatal I really do believe that I too I too believe these are symptomatic of the decline of Western culture And we and it will just go down flat. I don't think people realize that you know Masculinity still exists okay in the world as a code among jihadists, okay? And when you have passionate masculinity, okay? Circling the borders like the Huns and the Vandals during the Roman Empire that that's what I see I see this culture rotting from within okay, and disemboweling itself literally We have this Bit of combat let's say It produced a scandal Now we actually talked about it Yeah No tricks just a conversation And then everybody wins right because I can admit whatever mistakes I made she can admit whatever mistakes She made we can drop the persona So you're saying the polarization that we're seeing right now that we are speaking out. It's not In the future we will act out that polarization well if we don't if we keep Accelerating it especially if we keep accelerating with lies. Yeah, you know and and this this whole channel for Rat's nest is like 90% lies. Maybe more and You know a lot of its ideologically motivated lies, but it doesn't matter it still lies like Kathy as I said There was virtually nothing she said in that interview that was actually Coming from her like like a deep part of her the soul of her or so it was all persona It was all persona and and and all use of words in a in a Expedient manner as tools to obtain I think probably probably status dominant status and reputation I mean what advice would you give to people to? To navigate this new world the first is for your mind. Be aware of the fact that the habits of the blue church and And how it works Don't work anymore recognize that your way of making sense in the world that used to work Don't work, and you really really need to set yourself free to begin learning the new child's mind beginner's mind second this by nature must in fact be exploratory so Swim, do not make sense prematurely in spite of the fact that the world feels dangerous inside of that you may want to protect yourself in this dangerous world Doing so too quickly did not allow the natural exploratory Approach to do what it needs to do really, just listen and Learn go all the way dad back down to human base Turn inward Learn how fear shows up in you Learn how not to allow fear to drive the choices that you make Learn how to listen to the whole way that all of you perceives. What's going on become more integrated with your own body Go out into nature Spend a lot of time not connected to the chaos That's going on and a lot of time Reconnecting yourself with your fundamental capacity to perceive reality in all the different modalities these human beings have the capacity to do Then relearn how to use other human beings as allies in figuring out how to make sense of the world I mean that really relearn like we have been abused and constrained by institutional frameworks that remove us from our own native capabilities So relearn that understand how to be a friend and an ally how to have a conversation with somebody where you're really listening closely To get a sense of what their perspective brings to you where you're not obligated to agree with them We are not obligated to move out of what you feel is right to form some new Consensus reality, but where you're actually authentically? Recognizing that their perspective has some capacity to bring richness to your perspective This by the way is almost exclusively possible in person and what we're doing right now is an OK version of it But we need to be very mindful the fact that Linear broadcast is bad and even interactive Bandwidth like this. It's not good enough. You know you've got to learn from raw Physical and get yourself into places where your consensus reality, and your habits are willfully destroyed Human to human conversations and and get as far away from ideology as you can Your job is not to know what the fuck is going on Your job is to be absolutely certain that you have no idea what the fuck is going on and learn how to feel from raw chaos from raw uncertainty up Then and only then are you finally able to begin the journey of Beginning to form a collective intelligence in this new environment That's my advice this is why we've created rebel wisdom to host these conversations to try and unpack what's going on and through our workshops and events Start to build this collective intelligence for the future To see longer versions of the interviews featured in this film and our full-length documentary about Jordan Peterson check the rebel wisdom website Help us create more films about these subjects by sponsoring us on patreon and come to our events to have these conversations in person You"

coming on the show no problem having me your team and I appreciate that no problem yeah a fairly busy man well thank goodness really cuz when I started out on this journey 30 years ago um you know there weren't a lot of people who were interested in talking about these subjects and it was a very lonely road then but now as you say it's finding time to to talk to all the people that want to want to discuss this stuff so so we have made progress much as the world needs to make a lot more we have made progress in terms of people are now now more open to looking at things that they would have waved away by reflex action before so it's all it's all good yeah good and we'll touch on that 50 years ago you made that decision to speak openly about the things that you believe then which takes massive cottage so massive respect for that and I think people don't understand that to believe in something that no one else understands or to servicios things that people don't understand you have Coakley's and you said it yourself you were ridiculed and we'll go right back to the start of your life how it started where you were brought up and how you get involved and the stuff you're involved and no gold at all you got the I was born on a council estate in Leicester when we brother still lives in the same house in 1952 and we were skinned but you know it's a funny thing we were skinned and things were incredibly tight but I'd ever felt deprived you know you you you made your own fun and and stuff you didn't need a thing to do it you didn't need computers or smartphones and you you had to use your imagination and and you had to do things without any money and but I enjoyed my childhood I was watching steam trains and playing football and I know and I enjoyed it and I didn't perceive myself as deprived even though you know we were literally from week to week I I'm one of my earliest memories he's going around the back of the clock factory where my father worked on a Thursday lunchtime when he got paid and he would nip out the back didn't want to let anyone else see him to give me mother the pay packet he just had so we could eat that night it was that tight um you know I remember as a kid you would I didn't even realize for a long time why it was but the door would knock and then my mother would say quick Shh and she you should take us around the back of the sofa and we I'd be on the sofa and I'm a little boy what's going on and what was happening is the rent man would knock on the door and if there's no answer he'd go to the front window and looking look inside so we right so but but but oh you know I it wasn't you felt deprived and I I love my childhood and you know I wouldn't change it and that's always kind of that attitude to life was always stayed with me you know I'm not someone who you know looks down on people yeah because they don't have money or they don't appear so don't have that because I've been there and for me we're all individual expressions of the same consciousness just having different experiences and we should start supporting each other and seeing as all as as one consciousness having different experiences instead of self identifying with all these buddy labels you know for me that the world is controlled and humanity is controlled and controls itself and creates the very ground for which divide and rule is it possible which allows the few to control the many through its obsession with labels so we say your work I remember that that great scene on on the old David Frost program where you had the three guys John Cleese was one and and Ronnie Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett were that were the others and there were different sizes and and John Cleese Whizzer was was dressed as out rich man in the nice suit and then you had Ronnie Barker next one down he was kind of middle class in a trilby and then you had Ronnie Corbett little little guy on the end and he was kind of working-class with the flat cap you know or the cliches and and it was a wonderful thing the describing the way that labels dictate our interaction where one saying I look down on him because I am upper-class and then the guy in the middle was saying and I looked down on him because he is lower class and we both look up on him because he's upper-class and these labels and labels of race labels of sexuality labels of religion and and these are not who we are they are experiences that our consciousness is having our awareness is having and once you start self identifying with the label you start looking at yourself in terms of little me I am my label I am Ethel who works on the checkout at Tesco that's all I am no you are an expression of infinite awareness having an experience called Ethel on the checkout you know bill driving the bus you know you say to people who are you that you say well I'm bill I come from Manchester and I Drive a bus no no that's what you're experiencing bill is the name of your current experience what you are is consciousness having that experience and this might seem like esoteric navel-gazing but it's not it's a totally different way of interacting with the world and it's a total different way of self identifying yourself because when you when you say I M R and the labels then follow you are self identifying with limitation you're self identifying I am my experience and if I'm you know born in Leicester in a working-class council house then that that defines me that's that's who I have no no that's just where you were born you have the potential to be whatever you want to want to be and whatever you you you choose to be but what we've what we've got now is a massive extension even of that whereby your label is everything not only dirt there are people defining themselves by the labels the world is increasingly defining them more than ever before by them and this is where what we what we call today identity politics comes from where it's not about what is right or fair or just which is surely the way to look at anything it's how does this affect my label so if I'm transgender and something happens how does this affect my label if I'm this race or that race or that religion or that religion and something happens well how does this affect my label so people are constantly judging the world by how it affects their label instead of saying well done minute never mind all that is it right is it fair is it just no matter what labor is talking we're talking about is it fair is it just is it is it right and so what you have is a situation where we have developed this this belief among increasing numbers of people particularly young people through the universities and colleges whereby you judge everyone by a group and then you tag the group whether it's good or not good so therefore instead of seeing a world of individuals with individual thoughts opinions observations you judge everyone by a group so if you say something about one group you're a bigger you're a Nazi and a racist or or a fascist and if you say something about another group then and that group is labeled bad then you say what you bloody like about that we spoke about that le David if people are divided from religion from race that he's at they control the masses at ease that they can throw because everybody's fainting and arguing who's been I'm sorry and for me personally but all we call gold deserve a chance and to say at limits on yourself you're crazy because everything has limitless you're the one who can control and take whatever you wanted to believe for new man you start to judge on that David obviously you went through the Terry walking show which was massive for you because you come on not sure and you spoke out how you believed then and the things that you seen and you things you about educating yourself West because you always say they did the kilcher which I believe was it's sad when you watch that and of you am when you're working on that did you know that that was going to be the outcome yeah it's kind of funny um people people people said to me didn't you know that what happened if you said this and said that and I thought I said what do you know I'd worked that out but you say it anyway but but you see there's a lot of background with that because I was I was going through my life I left school at 15 I didn't take a major exam because I went to be a professional footballer with Coventry and and and others and then my career ended with rheumatoid arthritis I played a whole year of league football with rheumatoid arthritis that's whole story and in itself but what that did is it developed it developed in you because all these things are within us an experience brings them out and if you don't have experience often they don't come out so um I have this phrase um life tends to give us our greatest gifts brilliantly disguised as our worst nightmares because often our worst nightmare will will bring things out of us that wouldn't otherwise happen this is why if you if you bring your kids up and you protect them from everything you're doing them no favors because you're not developing strong people who will be able to deal with life you're developing people who are always looking to be protected and look look at what we have now and once you have a generation or or you have a population that wants to be protected and perceives itself all the time as being a victim where is the power a point of power move it moves to Authority because people look to Authority to protect them from what their fear or what they feel victimized by so what we have we've been developing is a population of emotionally weak people who perceive themselves in terms of victims when you have challenges in life and you meet them it brings something out of you so for instance when my my arthritis came and I didn't know what what else am I gonna do at that time I wanted to be a footballer I wanted be a footballer since I was a kid and now I'll be joints to swelling up and they're telling me I'm gonna have to pack it in now I've thought I'm not packing it in I want to give it a go so I went to a club called he referred United that was a league club then and I played the whole season with rheumatoid arthritis every morning when we were training and warming up for training on cold English mornings I was in agony and and and I would be limping and what-have-you and players were say oh what's wrong now I can die I would give a different excuse all got a bit of a pall oh I've got a bit of a blister but actually was the same thing all the kind and I played the season out and eventually got so bad that I couldn't carry on but he brought something out of me this this determination not not to give up and not to give in and then I I decided because when I was a kid I I was always reading newspapers and I was very interested in journalism so I became a journalist and long story short I eventually became a television presenter whoever had a well known back then yeah I was yeah I was I was a national television per century in those days which when I look at my life now you see and and what I'm doing my life before which appeared to be a series of random events same with you you've had your challenges their life what is it done it's made you the person you are you wouldn't be the person you are now without them and people say well I regret that or regret that well the thing to regret is if you don't learn from the experience that's the regret but learning from the experience well you've had a gift what you've written for and so I I went into journalism because I was very interested in that and I've actually became this television presenter and when you look at my life as I was saying um all the different elements of it including going into journalism and seeing the media for what it is going into politics with the Green Party and seeing politics for what it is what I didn't know at the time but they were all giving me very very important understandings that will be useful later on and then what happened is yes this is a kind of bizarre story but it happened I was I was in the Green Party and and I and I was still working for the BBC television presenter and both were leaving me completely cold you know the the the the beep the BBC it's it's not a great organization to work for if you care about the truth and you care about you know more than the official version of everything and I also was looking at the Green Party politics from the inside and seeing that it was just like every other party and so I was what do I do with my life now because I can't go on with either of these and what happened was a very strange thing happened because in the early part of what would it be 1989 I started having this feeling that when I was in a room alone I wasn't alone and it's like this it's like this there was an atmosphere there this there's something there and through 1989 this this got more and more and more powerful to the point where in early 1990 I was working for the BBC and I was it I was staying at a hotel called Kassadin Hilton just down for the BBC headquarters and I'm sitting on the side of the bed and in in this apparently empty room and and there there was such a sense of a presence there that I said into the room you know if there's something there would you please contact me because you'll drive me up the wall few days later I'm on the seafront with my son Gareth little boy then in ride where I live on the are white and I I go into this news agent shop where gas was looking at one of the books and I said to him come on guys we'll come and get some lunch in the town and and as I said it it was like the atmosphere changed like the energetic field around me changed and all I heard it wasn't it wasn't a voice it was a very strong thought form it said go and look at the books on the far side and I'm standing there thinking you know do not shut your so yeah that basically whatever so I start walking across to the books in inner inner day's thinking what is happening and I knew this bookshop that the books it sold were for you know the tourists had come to the art of white they were basically Mills and Boon and and and you know perfectly form English roses and having relationships with perfectly formed you know uniformed soldiers and all this stuff so I'm thinking what am I going over here for but right in the middle of these books was one called mind to mind by a woman called Betty shiner a picture was on the front it was different to the other side picked it up and I turn it over and I read the blurb and she was a psychic an English psychic and she was telling her life story so I bought the book read it in 24 hours found it very interesting contacted her because I wanted to go and see if she would pick up what the hell was happening around me for the last year and so I went I told her nothing what I told it was because she did this hands-on healing as well which is just an exchange of energy you know it's not mumbo-jumbo it's an exchange of energy okay yes it's just an exchange of energy that's what it is but anyway um I told her that because I said I've got arthritis maybe it will help because I didn't want to give anything away or what's happening to me so I'm sitting on this bench this medical-type bench in her front room you know she chatting away and she's doing that whole you know hands-on healing just next to my left knee and suddenly the atmosphere changed again and I felt like a spider's web on my face now what hit me was in her book she said when other levels of reality are trying to lock into you you sometimes feel like a spider's web when you face well I know what that what that was now it's electromagnetic energy you know you know when you you you you're in a crowd a football crowd with great emotional excitement you you feel like a charge of energy the hair stands up net you know that's electromagnetic fit their electromagnetic fields so that's what I was feeling but it did feel like a spider's web on the face and I said nothing but to the to the to the to Betty but I'm thinking what the hell and then about 10 or 15 seconds later she reels her head back and she said my god this is powerful I've got to close my eyes for this one I'm he bombs for going further down there what have you got to do yourself into here I key and she starts telling me in March 1990 there I'm gonna go out on a world stage and reveal great secrets I would face enormous opposition but they whatever that is would always be there to protect me and that there there was a shadow over the world that and there was a story that needed to be told that you manatee was gonna was going to go through a phase of waking up and coming out of basically its coma which is programming and that I was gonna go out and do that one man cannot change the world but one man can communicate the message that can change the world was one of the things she said and I'm sitting there I'm a television presenter for the BBC I'm a national spokesman for the Green Party and I'm thinking what are you talking so I then leave leave leave her and get on a train she lived near Hassocks in Sussex and and and or in her six actually and and then I drove up or went up in the train to present a television program but from that moment on what one of the things that was said that she said because she said the first thing she said she had no idea about this interaction in the Kensington Hill she's saying that they're telling me they know you you wanted them to contact you but the time wasn't right and you you you know now you've been brought here to be contacted and they said they're saying that you're gonna be led to knowledge and at other times knowledge will be put into your mind all right okay what so anyway after see at that time David the Jew think she was maybe crazy because you know understand that I'll be gee I don't work because when you speaker but stuff like that people go well he's maybe crazy but yeah again it's judging people and everybody's in their own different paths yeah I mean what I've been like may all my life is um I've never dismissed things that I can't know absolutely are not true I I have this policy I put things on the back burner and I see what comes and if more information comes to support it more incomplete nation comes to support it there comes a point where there's so much information supporting that that it crosses the line and you know you start to say okay I accept this is what's happening but I don't just dismiss things and never have on the basis that they're different just being the way I've always been was at the start of your John that end going unless women and everything like her weaken and I smell bacon yes yeah it was and and you know one of the one of the things was that you know it was going to be tough and and so when I left that left her house and got only life very very quickly synchronicity coincidences started to occur where I'd meet people come across information come across books come across documents whatever that was starting to like hand me puzzle pieces and I started to realize as it built up and it built up and it built up that actually the world was not like I thought it was well not like I thought it was really have you on that I just put in Washington I never did believe that politicians around the world I always felt there was something else but you didn't even you didn't know what it was now I was beginning to understand question everything works yeah and another thing that happened is that I would get just a knowing that this is how I think this is what's going on here and then what would follow would be names dates places hard factual information that would support that view which kind of connects with we will put knowledge into his mind and this has gone on now for 30 years and it's gone through different different phases of information and it's taken me down a an extraordinary road of uncovering the world as it is behind the facade of what we're told it is and of course it's taken me into realms of enormous ridicule and enormous abuse but we come back to the greatest gift are often that you ever given is your worst nightmare or what appears to be so if we go back to the Wogan show because what happened eventually is i went on the wagon show and talked about what was happening to me and at that time I was right in that period of the whoa good shows period of about three months I was going through an enormous transformation of that you doesn't understand I didn't understand no because this is what happened just very very very briefly is that I I suddenly got this feeling that I needed to go to Peru I didn't know why I never been there I watched him play in the World Cup a few times but I didn't know anything about it and long story short I ended up in Peru and and not as series of enormous ly amazing things happen to me and it culminated at a place called Cu star knee which is near a place called puno near Lake Titicaca highest navigable lake in the world they say about 13,000 feet and and I ended up and a series of synchronicities again at this so-called Inca site called Cu star knee which is all Inca ruins on a hill and there's a lake and mountains right in the middle of nowhere and I went and I looked around it and then I'd hired this taxi and this guide came with me and we're driving away from Cu starting and I'm just daydreaming which I do all the time daydreaming out the window he sold mine wandering and I'm looking at this hill as we're coming towards it and as I looked at this hill all I could hear in my head was come to me come to me come to me you know and I'm thinking you know I was introducing I was introducing the snooker not long ago actually and now this freakin Hills talking to me Steve Davis Jimmy White all is forgiven and so I asked the guy to stop I said I won't be a minute I'm going up that hill and I walked up the hill and I didn't know where I was going or why and um there's this all these kind of stones it's kind of a kind of circle like a stones and I walked into the middle and it's beautiful and there's not a cloud in the sky it's a pure blue Peruvian sky piercing Sun red nose to prove it and I stood there and what happened to me then happened to me I'm cover this bit in the new shop in ride where I'm standing there and suddenly I feel like my feet are being pulled to the ground and like in like magnetically and I'm feeling like a drill in the top of my head and the atmosphere changed again OD this was much more powerful than the news show and I heard this again very strong thought form go through my mind which said first of all they'll be talking about this a hundred years from now what and then which saint seemed absolutely crazy given the sky in the Sun and it will be over when you feel the rain right and then what happened is my arms went out like that without me making any decision to do to to do that and then this energy got more and more powerful and in the end my body's shaking and and what what's happening it's like when you drive in a car and you can't remember the last mile your subconscious has been driving the car thank goodness I kept coming back to some kind of consciousness and then going back somewhere else and as I came back to consciousness at one point my conscious mind I noticed that over the far distant mountains there was a light gray mist and I'm watching it and it's getting dark and it's getting darker faster and I think it's frickin raining and then over not very long the whole thing took maybe I don't know an hour 45 minutes an hour this storm came out of the I mean you couldn't make it up if you put if you put this on it on a movie they'd say oh come on it happened this this storm is coming towards me and you know whether people talk about a front yeah well this is a front it's a straight bloody line I'm looking up it's it's it's literally out with some crazy movie and this and it's stair rod rain it's not just raining it's steroid rain and it's coming towards me and I'm standing there and I'm seeing this wall of water coming towards me it's like something out of bloody Moses Brecon Red Sea and and and by this time and the body's shaking like crazy with this energy coming through me and then the water hit me I mean I mean it mediately drenched because it's stair ron rain and bang the energy stopped and I staggered forward like Bambi because my legs were gone and there were energy pouring out me feet and pouring out me hands and it's still pouring out there me feet I couldn't sleep that night because of it and something changed i if you people could imagine you lived your life in a bubble literally a bubble of information a bubble of perception and someone's come along without any warning and pop the bloody thing and suddenly everything that was outside the bubble was pouring in so my mind is absolutely awash with information concepts insights what the hell was going on that it was just a chaotic massive of information and thought and everything and in that period it lasted about three months if you'd have asked me my name and I checked and that it was in that period in me turquoise shell suit that I went on to the the Wogan show and and everything that that that that happened and after about three months after all the ridicule and all the newspapers and all that stuff basically you know when you you you press too many keys on a computer in the computer freezes says I can't process this well that was me there was so much information pouring into my conscious mind as a result of that experience in Peru I could process it you basically froze what happened after three months is it unfroze and now I'm the old David again but I ain't just more I'm seeing the world in completely different way I'm see I'm as they as they say when you read a newspaper the truth is in the white bits not the words the bits in between you know you and so I was seeing things and connections that I couldn't see before did you have a question yourself they'll David I think am I losing my mind Danny to go and get help or the discrete Fourier that well understand that about more well it felt right to me I would say I completely understood it then it felt right to me and and I IIIi did I did what I always do like I've just mentioned earlier I thought okay I'm going with this and we're gonna see where it's gonna go and I didn't know where he was going but I'm gonna go with this and see where it goes and people were coming up to me after that you know Shh unfreezing and they were saying it thought they thought you'd got mad you're the same Dave we used to know but I wasn't I appeared to be but I wasn't I was seeing the world in a completely different way and of course in in a world which is overwhelmingly programmed to see the world in a certain way it's what happens through the education system and the media and peer pressure it's very very narrow band of sense of the possible sense of what is when you start talking about things that are different to that then immediately the reaction is you're crazy or you're dangerous or in my case you're both but what followed what followed of course was mass ridicule as a report the Wogan show and people said you know it must have been horrible what it was but it was the greatest gift I ever have been given because it set me free of the prison that most people live in which is the fear of what other people think when you literally can't walk down the street without being laughed at I mean I lived my life for a long time after that to the sound of distant or even close laughter going into a pub forget it and so you either go under and you disappear but majority people do yeah or you come out like steel honed in the fire and you let go of this this this prison this ball and chain that most of the population of the world live in the fear of what other people think most people the vast majority of people because of this fear are not living their truth they're not living their life they're not living their uniqueness they're living what they think is acceptable to other peoples of what they should be so they they go through mental gymnastics before saying things even more today with political correctness and all this bollocks what can I say so they won't say I'm this or that or or what can I say and how can I say it so they won't think I'm mad now when the world appears it wasn't the world there were others that saw through it but certainly appeared to be the world and was the vast majority or ridiculing you mercilessly I mean someone only had to say my name in in a in a comedy thing I'm in with David Frost just mentioned my name in a raw Variety Performance the bloody audience laugh did you know joke necessary how did that affect you in your family did you ever think that moving up here did you find yourself I can't handle us will you ever so saved or what anything David no absolutely all right no I'm a I'm a stubborn bugger me and and the more the more you tell me what I can't say the more I'll say it the more tell me what I can't do I'll do it and uh but there was there was something obviously you've got confusion what the hell is happening to me what's happening but there's a there was a core beyond that that somehow just knew this was going to be okay and it was leading somewhere and just some knowing that you can't really explain and I get I tell you a story a true story I'm sitting on I'm sitting in the seat on the wagon show and he's talking to me and the audience are laughing and and David Icke they experience her experience rather not the experience sir the experience was was dying but something something beyond that was saying to me as it was happening this is leading somewhere it's gonna be okay it's gonna be fine it's gonna okay be okay and that doubt that that wherever that was coming from that kind of kept me going through all this period of ridicule and you know I didn't know at that point of course some of the things that I was going to be taught about I didn't know what was coming and what was gonna be uncovering and all that stuff so many things on that sure David yeah yeah yeah covered because you went back on their walking sure wish you'd done apologize for it came true yeah so many stuff so again that's showing that you stood up for what you believe done it that come to what do you think David as humans who are we as individuals who are these people wild winless planet do you think well let's put this planet into and this experience into context which is something you almost never hear we have unbelievable numbers of television channels radio channels now 24/7 beaming out all over the world all the time how often comparatively do you see programs about the nature of reality actually actually who are we what is this place what we doing here surely that would be at the center of questioning but it's not it's marginalized because if you have a population that is living a reality which actually doesn't exist but they experience it as if it does you've already put them in a cul-de-sac of perception and that's where you want them if a few are going to control the many you can't have an enlightened population you've got to have an ignorant population that believes in things that aren't real and that's why you hit so many lies pour out of politics because they're trying to get the population to believe something that's not true but this is a much deeper level of it let's get them to believe in a reality that's not true while the very few not the politicians are overwhelmingly the ignorant is anyone else if not more so but at the core in the shadows they understand how reality works and they want the population not to know that's why you don't have this who are we where are we how does all this work discussed in it in any length or even at all mostly in the media but let's put this into perspective if I said to most people if you look into this room can you see everything in the room everything in the space that you're looking at there go oh yeah of course again no Yukon 450 mansions yeah um according to mainstream science the electromagnetic spectrum which is basically the reality we live in um is naught point naught nor 5% of what exists in the universe and the universe is only one construct within infinity and visible light which is the only frequency band that we can see everything we see visually is within this band visible light is a smear of the naught point naught naught 5% some say it's a bit more as much as naught point five percent but negligible whatever and therefore what we're not actually living in a world we're living in a band of frequency tiny which contains an informational field or fields and we are interacting with those informational fields just like a computer interacts with Wi-Fi and we are decoding those informational fields into what appears to be and we experience as a solid whoa oh there you go yeah so human beings who do you think for us here are weak are we the aliens are we computers are we what is the question I should be asking here because as I think about it all the time who the __ are we who am i what am I here for and are we are we come from apes are we fish are we so many questions you can ask that what's true what's real was big we don't come from apes that's another kind of because ours Apes though here the fuel yes but you know when you follow that story back it's it's a nonsense but it's a great diversion from what's actually going on because are we computers at the level of consciousness no see if you said to me who are you I would say I am awareness I am a state of being aware forget the body forget everything in my base form I am a a state of awareness I am a point of attention within an infinite stream of awareness and you are a point of attention in the same street and of awareness and so's everybody else but your point of attention which is influenced by your life experience sees the world in a certain way and my point of attention sees it in a certain way but we're all together points of attention within the same stream of consciousness this is what makes racism and sexism and all these isms utterly nonsensical unfortunately if you want to find racists then go and find anti-racists because anti-racists are obsessed with what race they see race everywhere in other words we're back to the labels they see labels everywhere you are a that race label you are at that race label no doesn't matter if you're black white or sky-blue pink they're just vehicles for experience transitory experiences and do you think we are we are Muslim or black or white or Hindu when we leave the body of course not that that's that these are these are belief systems within this tiny band of frequency we call the world and because we self-identify with them instead of just enjoying them you know I like being a Muslim I like being a white guy I like being a black guy okay fine it's an experience enjoy but don't think it's you because once you think that your labels are you bang and so what I what that what transformed my life is when I started to understand this and I started to self-identify not with David Icke as Who I am but as what I'm experiencing but what I am is consciousness having the experience that's what's leaving the body at what we call a near-death experience when people leave the body they've got no eyes but they can still see they've got no brain but they can still think it's because um they are consciousness and consciousness as the ability to to hear think everything but the body what the body does you think of consciousness consciousness does not if you like vibrate it's not within the frequency band of this reality we're experiencing so it's like radio one radio two radio three or four are all sharing the same space but they don't interfere with each other why cuz because they're not on the same frequency so consciousness is not on in the range of frequency that we are directly experiencing in what we call the physical world so to experience these this band of frequency this reality the our consciousness takes on and it what we call an external form which is operating within the frequency band of this world and because of that I can pick that glass up my consciousness could not pick that glass up because it's on a completely different frequency to the glass but but operating through this this outer shell what I call a biological computer and it can pick the glass up because there are compatible frequencies of you think sort of David do you think those other species on this planet because you spoke about that very few quite a lot you've law what whereabouts do you think those other people walking among those as well absolutely I mean let's put this again into into context according to mainstream science if you compare the size of planet Earth with the size of the projected size of the universe planet Earth is the equivalent of a billionth of a pinhead so if you say that life as we know it only exists on a billionth of a pinhead within the greater reality you are well yeah yeah well that's credible you you could be an academic saying that but you say actually hold on a minute elephant living room sofa billionth of a pinhead night sky which is a tiny fraction even of one galaxy and there's billions of galaxies in the universe they say now despite all that life is Mike but we're saying that life as we know it only exists on a billionth of a pinhead and nowhere else I mean it's insanity and then you think this looking at the vastness of different forms that exists in animals in insects in in nature in all of it even in the human race look at someone from China or someone from Asia and some off to South America from South Africa from from from Europe look look at the differences you'd look at the range of form of different form and expressions of form that exist within a smear of naught point naught naught 5% of the universe what the heck in the infinity beyond this reality which is almost the entirety of everything what the heck exists out there in terms of form but and different expressions of conscious hope does in all ways out David see I'm a man who questions everything unless I see more knives I struggle to believer and people say oh I don't believe in conspiracy if you use a me touched on earlier I believe in science but is it because unless you see it with your own eyes that everything is aware you perceive things are your perception how do you actually know what's out there how do we know we're not on a snow globe boat up in all the worlds not flower around hope they're in all the answers what basically you don't in terms of you know every I dotted and every T crossed all you can do is put the information that you together and come to conclusions that's that's all you can you can really do but you know when I'm talking about non-human non-human races interacting with and manipulating human society I've not sat in a darkened room and pulled it out the bloody eath smoking a weed ii-i've been to more than 60 countries over 30 years researching this I've talked to whistleblowers on the inside of the American military and intelligence complex many of them I've talked to shamans around the world who are carriers of the ancient knowledge of those societies and when you put what the to say together you you you get the same answer that yes there is a nonhuman force that is manipulating human society and and you see it in ancient accounts you see the common themes around the world in different cultures describing the same thing and you see one common theme for instance which is that this non-human force manipulated human genetics this comes out in the Old Testament for instance as the sons of God who interbred with the daughters of men people say oh that's a that's if that's that's in the Bible yes it is but but the theme is everywhere in non Bible countries galore a cultures galore and and so you put it all together and then you come to conclusions then you write it down you connect the dots and then you put it out and then people decide whether they want to believe it or not that's that's the that that's the deal but you know when you look at how narrow the band is that we can see and perceive I don't I might my my experience over the last thirty years says to me that's not an accident mm-hmm somehow human genetics has been manipulated to only perceive a very narrow band of reality which makes us obviously far more controllable and you talk you always talk about being controlled or talking about you spoke about it years ago David about kids getting microchipped and now we're getting Michael checked where they can follow us about and the Illuminati can you touch on that the people who a small percentage of the people who control the world well one of the things that you know it's a head shaker to me and I smile to myself these days is over the years people have told me Authority has told me authorities trying to tell me even more now but I'm wrong and because I'm wrong I can't say what I'm saying and right what I'm writing and then they prove me bloody right you know I I said I said back in the back in the 90s when I was producing the first books that there was a plan for the world and that plan included the destruction of freedom of speech and the creation of a centrally controlled global fascist communist noxus whatever you want to call it state they're all different terms for the same tyranny that this included microchipping the population don't even start me on that is way way way along the line already and that money would be taken out circulation so only cashless money would digital money would be used which has fundamental implications for freedom and control and a stream of other things which have all come true and the reason I could do that is very simple how did oldest Huxley in 1932 in his book brave new world how was he able to describe genetic drug and other things that in a dystopian way that is now happening how could George Orwell be so accurate in 1948 what about the other people that I quote in my books insiders way back who were saying this is what's going to happen cuz this is the plan and it's all happening in detail not even theme detail because there is a plan there is a script and what I've done for the last 30 years is work to uncover what that is and once you do which you know what's plan and predicting the future is is quite straightforward that's why so many you know I I see my books from the 1990s read on the TV news everyday now in changes in society it's because I have this phrase know the outcome and you'll see the journey if you don't know what the outcome is planned to be then what happens in the world in world events and daily happenings appear to be random they seem to have no pattern they seem no I have no rhyme and reason they just happen or there you blame them on something else when you know what the outcome is planned to be which is what I've been in covering all these years then you start to see that these apparently random events are not random at all they are stepping stones towards the outcome you talk about we talk about freedom of speech freedom of speech is being systematically destroyed and I'll give you the outcome on that the outcome desired outcome is that there comes a point which we're moving towards so fast when no one will ever see or hear anything that is not acceptable to the authorities to the system and we are seeing now daily freedom of speech and censorship being increased and increased and increased towards that desired outcome of deleting all information that the authorities don't want people to see now what's been happening the internet was actually created by this cabal but we can talk about that if you like about you know why that was and where where it's going but one of the reasons is that they wanted to put all information eventually that people receive and where they get their information thus their perceptions which come from information received that's what perceptions are from the internet digitally and the reason they want to do that is because once it's digital then you can use algorithms to censor you don't even need human input once the codes are in place the algorithms as they're doing now censor what people can see in here now what is freedom of speech it's the freedom to speak and if you have the freedom to speak then you have the ability to challenge the prevailing narrative and thus you're never in a situation where people only see in here what the authorities want you can see in here for that to be reached that situation free speech has to be deleted otherwise they're not going to get there that's why free speech is being deleted and George Orwell had this this concept of freedom in effect being the ability to say that two and two equals four because while you can you have the right to say two and two equals four you have the right to freedom of speech you have the right to speak factually and not be censored even though you're speaking fact but error wrong facts from the authorities point of view and in 1984 in the book society moved to a point where they they were told they had to believe that two and two equaled five and you couldn't say totally good for anymore you had to believe that two inch we were called five because that's what the authority wanted you to believe so they got the outcome that they wanted and what happens is that initially and we're in that point now when you're being pressured to believe two and two equals five and to say it and not contradict it there is a resistance which says why it's a load of bloody nonsense turnt orders even equal five but when you then start giving people consequences for not accepting to a jerkles five abuse losing your job all the rest of it marginalization people then start in search of self-respect they don't want to they don't want to accept that what they're doing is being cowed into saying two and two across five when they know it's fall so they start to convince themselves two and two equals five so it becomes not they're in for reality eventually it becomes their perceived reality and some but suddenly the world's gone frickin mad and that is absolutely the process that's happening now what level of madness may have we reached when professors of biology are being investigated by their universities and abused by students for saying that men and women are biologically different men and women are biologically different okay men are women are biologically different another way of putting it two and two equals four but the so-called progressive they're not at all the fascist thick Marxist whichever term you want to use progressive narcissistic stormtroopers of political correctness Twitter stormtroopers are insisting that you believe two and two equals five and it's a very simple thing if you want something to happen which if you had an open debate you couldn't win it and therefore it couldn't happen you simply don't have the debate and you know I have a phrase if you want to know and see that the foundation elements of this agenda of human mass control look at the subjects you cannot have another opinion about look at the subjects where if you have a different opinion to the official narrative you're going to get abuse ridicule and other consequences that's the agenda shutting up simply simply for this reason if you can't win a debate on facts and of course men and women are not biologically different is not a debate you can win on facts then you don't have the debate you shout down abuse people who have that and we're talking beforehand I posted something on my website today which I saw this morning where there's a there's a meeting at a university in America and there's speakers they're a woman stand I should stand up she's sitting down but a woman's spoke one of the speakers who was kind of a an academic in her field and she said what it's obviously that there are biological differences between men and women because if you look at the facts fa cts I think that spell people will forget that soon then the vast majority of men are taller than women women have different fat in different places they have different muscular types people in the audience started walking out she's just saying the bloody obvious and they're walking out why she's saying two and two equals four they believe two and two equals five and I insist everyone else does cameraman follows them out and they're out in the lobby saying that's Fassett that's fascist we can't sit and listen to that fascism what that men and women are biologically different this is where we are going and this is why it's so important that people are not intimidated into silence because I meet so many people who say yes alone and nonsense but you know what look what happens if you say so and and you know one of my roles if you like is a being the kid pointing at the naked Emperor while everyone's sycophant eclis hovering around saying wonderful new clothes Emperor oh what a lovely jacket and I'm saying hold on it the guy's freaking naked closer what are you talking about and that of course is two and two equals four thank you pot roast you'll notice because they are and it's systemic it's being done systematically condition report to to shopping but what is political correctness I'll keep it in a line it's manipulating the target population to silence itself that's what it is in false flag events David you've you've blue device worn a couple of them what as a false flag event yeah event for people who don't know well one of the things that I one of the phrases I came up it has now become into quite common parlance in the alternative media anyway I came up with it in the 1990s was problem reaction solution this is so important there's there's two mass manipulation techniques because this is the bottom line this conspiracy is a conspiracy to psychologically program the population why do people behave the way they do why does someone behave that way and someone behave that way perception that person's perception leads them to behave that way this person perception leads them to to behave this way and where does perception come from information received people process information received and they reach their perception so if you can control information received you control perception you control behavior this is what happens when you control information and if you control it totally which is where they're going this I've just talked about then you eventually control behavior totally because you're controlling all perception what problem reaction solution and it's stablemate what I call the totalitarian tiptoe our our psychological manipulation techniques and they used on us all the time problem reaction solution other people call it false flag you want to change the world in a certain way and you know that if you stand up and openly say this is what we're gonna do you're gonna get a big resistance against it people are gonna say we're not having that what's going on when what are you doing that for there's no reason so what you do is you give them a reason stage one you create a problem could be a terrorist attack it could be a financial collapse it could be a government collapse it could be whatever you then tell the population via an unquestioning and pathetic mainstream media the version of that problem you want them to believe you name the villain you name the reason for why that problem is happening when you in the shadows have actually made it happen at stage two a problem reaction solution you want a reaction from the public of outrage of fear of whatever the reaction is required and then you want them to in effect say do something something must be done and then those who've created the problem covertly and blamed someone else and got you to believe it then offer the solutions to the problems they've created and they are solutions that push on this agenda for the world more and more control more and more centralization of power more and more dictatorship um and they they can make that happen with the solution to a manufactured problem that they couldn't have done without the problem and so how much freedom has been taken away because of terrorist attacks well what if what if not everyone but what if many of those terrorist attacks were actually not what they appear to be but were actually orchestrated by the very system that wants to change society and you know this create the problem offer the solution is happening all the time and that links in with something else I've mentioned the totalitarian tiptoe you're at a and you want to take the world to Z you know if you go in to bigger leap towards ed the change is going to be so dramatic that people are going to look up from the game show or the sport and say what's happening so you go as far as you can as fast as you can but not so far you alert too many people to the fact that there's a pattern here and so you have a problem reaction solution and you take a step deleting freedom do more surveillance more control then you have another problem reaction solution and you do it more and you do it more and you do it more if you look at the European Union it's a classic totalitarian tiptoe we were told we were joining a a free-trade area called the common market good for jobs okay that's where it starts but they were that's not where it was planned to finish that was just the foot in the door and then you have more and more centralization of power well if we centralized power it would be more efficient you know over this and over that and over that and well that start and then it goes on and on and on until we've reached the point now where Europe is controlled in fine detail by a handful of bureaucrats that the vast majority of people in Europe couldn't even name and and I had to smile the other the other the other month in my books in the 1990s I said the plan is for a European army and EU army our load of rubbish we've got NATO ridiculous now last few months Merkel and in Germany and macron in France who were just puppets of this whole thing like May and and Trump and all of them they've come out and said we've had an idea we've had an idea we should have a European army what do you mean you've had an idea how did I know about it in 1993 how much stuff if you said David that's came through does it scared you the stuff at the house came through and go I __ told you so did you set by and go tour geez no I don't what well what what I what I do is I point out when things happen that I said them but I don't I'm way back but I don't say see told you so I do it for a reason and this reason if I knew about it 20 30 years ago it's not random is it it's not just happening it's planned otherwise I couldn't have known it how could all I've known it how could Huxley have known it and these other people that I quote how could they have known it how could someone I quote in in the books a rockefeller big-time rockefeller insider have described the internet that was coming in 1969 how could he have done that how could he have said in 1969 we are gonna make boys and girls the same how would he have known that because there's a plan and it's projected much further ahead than people think the real answers people control them what old maybe are a hundred years ahead 200 years yeah because it's another big story once you would you go off into another force that's not human their timeline and their projections are not the same that we live in where we you know if you're going down a river on a canoe you see as far as the next turn in the river but what if there's a force that can see the whole the whole river all the from start to finish then they have a completely different timeline in a different ability to project the future how did George Orwell know about Smart TVs Smart TVs and we're only seeing mark one two three at the moment not where they plan to go they have cameras in them and microphones in them that film you ain't confirmed we're in your front room and record your conversations in your front room well admits about was it submitted you know somebody found them and then they had to admit that it was true in 1984 which came out in 1948 George Orwell was talking about in in the 1984 Society that there were telly screens in every home and the telescreens were constantly filming you but big brother's watching these brothers watching so because it's a projected projected long into the future if you can access that either of course you're an insider or you know thirty years of bloody research full time then you can you can predict the future because the simple thing is if nothing intervenes to stop that process unfolding that will happen so you can predict the future the whole point of what I do is to alert enough people eventually to all these things that there is an intervention and it is stopped because of few people and it is a few in full knowledge in the shadows cannot manipulate and direct the lives of seven point seven billion because they don't have the numbers to do it they have to manipulate the perceptions of the population which becomes the behavior of the population thus the population behaves in a way that the few can control the many and the key factor above all other factors is to keep that target population in complete ignorance of what you're doing and so the more that you can uncover it and communicate it and people become aware that this is happening and thus events in the world are happening because of this are not randomly the more chance there is of an intervention and the population saying we're not having it the people you've spoke out against ever the most powerful people in the world the other get scared that they'll take over your life that the pineal they'll try and shut you up because I've tried so many times to shut you up there's no banned you from us through yeah yeah you ever feel that I'm endangered here have you ever felt your life in danger from the high up pebbles and the people who control the world never crosses my mind no I mean that might be hard for people to believe but it's true it never crosses my mind and and for this reason a we're more powerful when we take our power back than ever we believe we are and you know I look on these people as pathetic little boys in short trousers little boys and girls in short trousers because what kind of psychopathic insanity does it take to want to impose your will over a vast population of people I mean it's pathetic they are pathetic I'm gonna be frightened of them are you having a laugh no way and this is the other point is this once you start self identifying with being consciousness that's my eternal state your external tape at state everyone's eternal state consciousness a state of awareness well whether it's in this body or be out of this body eventually anyway at some point whether it's in this body or not in this bodies is almost irrelevant because it's always the state of consciousness having an experience of some kind so the worst that can happen to me is that I leave this body right and I will eventually anyway going to stay here forever my god but you can have too much of a good thing so it never crosses my mind if you're taken out you taken out but you're taken out trying to do the right thing and it takes courage well do you think no David well courage courage is overcoming fear which is a really powerful thing courage overcoming fear when you let go of fear you don't need courage you just do it it's not like you know if I said I've just written a book finished it it's gonna be probably the most controversial book certainly given current times probably going to be one of the most controversial books ever written and and so I know what's coming with it but I don't fear it used to I don't fear it because I'm putting out what I believe to be right and I don't need courage to put it out cuz I don't fear putting it out because don't fear the reaction the reaction is what it is so you react yeah and a lot of people abroad people are going to read it and go thank God someone's saying it at last and the system's gonna say ban him condemn him couldn't you think that doing the same thing which I'm carry know that but they dead per few years ago tried to kill them and call them crazy and say oh they're bad shot towards them because he's came to hurt us but it's all weakling he wants to stay away from the media and dude he's under words and just try to heal himself and get away from the fold shut there was involved them for so long well I I spent an evening with Jim Carrey actually read it home with my son Jamie some years ago when I was in LA and we had a very interesting chat and again Jim Carrey's had a experience similar to me where we're basically the bubble popped and the Whale lifted and it can be a challenging time because suddenly you're perceiving another reality that's so different to the one you've been perceiving before and of course when you start talking about it for reasons we've discussed you're going to get ridiculed for it by the mainstream the trick is not to care and from what I've seen of Jim you don't care and you know you know people just thought look oh look at this the range of things you perceive is that really the limit of what there is to perceive is that really the limit of what there is to know is that the limit of ways of seeing the subjects you have views about well of course not it's a tiny tiny tiny fraction anybody's views are a tiny fraction of possibility so why aren't we exploring all possibility not that you you you come across information and just because you come across it all that's true then I'll believe that now no you question it you you process it you come to conclusions about it but it's very simple and history shows us this systematically reducing the amount of information views and diversity of information and views available to people never ends up well it never turns out good it always turns out bad for Humanity because you look at any tyranny fascist tyranny communist tyranny whatever it is whenever they get power they want to destroy all alternative information and view the challenges what they want people to believe every time so whenever you're in a situation where the free flow of information and view and opinion is being censored you are in a tyranny and what humanity has allowed itself not everybody of course but great numbers especially the political correctness group is is they've allowed themselves to become a tyranny while claiming to be anti tyranny I see anti-fascist protests full of people acting for cystic lis because they're so far up their own arse and so full of their own self purity they don't realize that what they're doing is actually projecting their own behavior in what their opposing anyone who gives someone a hard time for having a different view however much they may not agree with it is a psychological fascist in my view because they are seeking to impose their will on someone else and it's quite simple you let all information be circulated and then people make their own minds up what they want to believe on what they don't believe and this is a key what we're seeing now not least through algorithms and and through self-censorship by being intimidated into into being terrified of speaking your truth we're seeing information censored before the point of delivery before anyone can hear it this is fundamental because I believe that all information and all views should be allowed to be expressed because if anyone is censored from expressing those beliefs then no one has freedom of speech freedom of speech is freedom of speech the freedom to speak it's not freedom to speak what is acceptable it's the freedom to speak and once anyone is censored freedom of speech is dead because what's left is only what is acceptable to speak and that's not freedom of speech and then what they've done and what they're doing all the time he's squeezing that acceptability so freedom of speech gets narrower and narrower until it disappears altogether and so what we have is a situation where if people are allowed to say and communicate whatever they want that is a situation where no authority in any form has the power to decide what people see in here once you start censoring before the point of delivery which as I say algorithms and self-censorship is now doing you are giving authority the power to decide what people see in here and of course it starts out with one excuse we must stop jihad is you know justifying or promoting violence okay Oh fake news fake news what's fake news whatever we say it is yeah we've got to stop people saying fake news so we're gonna censor that oh the more people we can get to be victims and upset the more excuses we've got to censor even more right yeah so give people all the excuses they want to be upset and to be feel a victim then then we can censor people saying things that upset them and so you're moving along this road none of that can happen when we have the free flow of information nothing censored so people say well what about you know saying go and kill people yeah but there's loss against that there's noise against that there's loss against telling people or burn that house down but they're after the point of delivery which means you can deal with the extremes of what our people use speech but it's it's heard but then you can deal with it if it needs dealing with it most speech does not need dealing with it all you know come on let's go and kill this person well obviously you know you deal with that you have to deal with that but it's after the point of delivery and as long as we hold that line authority has no power to censor what we're seeing now is the opposite of that that be up before that line is where most censorship is starting to happen and thus freedom is disappear do you think the burgers cover up or not planet as David for your perspective oh I think the biggest cover-up is the conspiracy and totality because you know people say to me sometimes you seem to see conspiracies everywhere I don't see one conspiracy with multiple faces and multiple facets but not the same as seeing conspiracies everywhere and it's simply this that there is a cabal that wants to create a situation which I've been saying since the 1990s and early 1990s and look at it now where we have a world government a world central bank the world government dictating to every community on earth a world central bank dictating all finance a world single digital currency which means that through algorithms and even you know human input you can wipe someone's bank account away because there's no cash in that society you think you got money there you go you can do it you can do it um very simply it's control you go into a shop now and you end over a credit card electronic money and they say sorry what's except your card you can still pay cash when there's no cash and they say well except your card or your microchip as it's meant to be eventually then whoever controls the computer controls if you have the ability to purchase anything so that's all about control they want a world army to impose the will of the world government and that is mcc's Panchal expansion of NATO this European army is all part of that that they're proposing and they want a microchipped population connected to a global computer system actually what what is what is known as the smart grid you know this technological society is a Trojan horse of monumental proportions and if people remember nothing they should remember this they're now openly talking people like Ray Kurzweil at the Google executive you know Google Facebook all these organizations Amazon they're all controlled by the same force to the same end that's why they're becoming monopolies we're dictating to people what they can see in here and all that stuff it's all planned but what Ray Kurzweil is talking about now and people like him is that by around the year 2030 humanity will be have their brains connected to artificial intelligence and he's very open about it as this goes on artificial intelligence will do more and more of human thinking until human thinking as we know it now is basically negligible in other words you'll be a computer terminal and someone else's internet and the reason they're being so open about it is there is the sales pitch which is you'll be superhuman if you do this and what you'll be is subhuman and human consciousness human thought human emotion as we've known it will be over because every thought every emotional response will come from AI he who controls AI will then control every humans perceptions directly who is connected to AI and we've been taken along a very clear process to take us to that point Stage one see I'm coming up 67 and I'm glad I was born when I have doing what I'm doing now because I have a radar I can remember what the world was like before people born into it you see when you get born into the world the world appear you you think the world is how it is because you're born into it this is how it is okay but it's not how it always was when you're born into the world as it is you don't really have so much of a compass to to get a fix on the world as it is because it's just how it is when you were born before it is as it is now you have a compass you have a comparison you can see the scale the stunning scale of the change not least since this technological society kicked in and and then went kind of on steroids stage one you get the population addicted to technology they can hold but basically achieved smartphones tablets except and you target especially the young why cuz they're gonna be the adults at the point you want to bring in this full-blown ai-controlled human you want them so addicted and obsessed with technology that as happens now on one expression of it they'll get up in the middle of the night and go and cue in the dark outside an apple bloody store to get the first version of the new thing get them addicted enough and they'll queue up waiting to be connected to AI right so that's why they're targeting the young stage true because what you want to do you want to get in the body and if they went directly to the body but anything in between people go what's going on totalitarian tiptoe you see so the next stage is on the body what they call wearables holder balls - wearables this is your your Apple watch and your Bluetooth and all these gadgets now that people where they're connected to the Internet and then you go to the next stage which is in the body I spoke there while ago last year in Sweden and people thousands of people now in Sweden have be microchipped and and queuing up for it having parties to celebrate microchips and and this is what happens with addiction um it's called addiction for a reason you were addicted and so this is this has been the process that is taking us along here kitty kitty kitty here kitty kitty kitty along this road to the point where they want to introduce fully-blown ai-controlled humans this is where it's going and it's within the lifetime well within the lifetime of people alive today even those that aren't young it's within their lifetimes - and and and all these diversions look here look here smell this look at this here this are all to stop us going deep breath take a step back look at it again shite look what they're doing and that's what I'm doing you know I'm pointing this out I'm saying over here see sofa elephant elephant not giraffe elephant but there it is before we funny shot David and what I thought Sean ho ho true as the heart the way that control Hojo's not 100% yeah what is whether its energy there in it what is the whether its electromagnetic information fields or something over there that controls the weather the heart was it such them that are perfect well HAARP in Alaska is is one of them they're called ionosphere heaters but there's many of them now and they are high-powered radiofrequency technology that manipulates the electromagnetic field of the planet and within that electromagnetic field is are the fields of energy that we call weather so if you can manipulate those fields to act in different ways you can manipulate the weather you can create hurricanes you can create tornados you know what a tornado is it's a fast rotating electromagnetic field that's all it is that's why they appear during electrical storms it's electromagnetic fields spinning and you can spin electromagnetic fields and create tornadoes you can manipulate the field so that rain doesn't manifest you can create a drought or you can you can make rain manifest massively and you can you can get floods this is this is this is what you can do in fact I'll give you a very quick example going way back to what was it the 50s 50s I think it was 60s 50s something it was there was a rainstorm in place called Lynn meth in Devon that was so fantastic in such a short time that the river that comes down actually the stream not really a river down through the town into the sea was a vast wall of water that killed a great number of people I think it was not it was 1952 keeps coming to mind destroyed so many houses devastated the place and it was 250 times the rainfall that would be expected in that area right all these years later decades and decades later the BBC radio to be fair they don't do many good investigations then this was one they did an investigation program that established that the RAF had flown over that area just before and they'd sent out chemicals into the clouds that stimulated rain it was an experiment just came true well that's chemtrails which are of course they come out the back of planes and not contrails because they disappear because they're based on condensation and heat chemtrails come out of the plane and don't disappear they just pan out and eventually fall to earth were they're full of lots of things and and yes they are indirectly affecting the effect in the weather affecting many other things I my last book was called everything you need to know and have never been but I've never been told and it goes into some of this in detail that we're talking about now and all the other stuff we talked about but manipulating the weather is is is is very straightforward these days through technology but remember I said they manipulate the weather by manipulating electromagnetic fields that dictate the weather the body the brain is an expression of electromagnetic fields and electrical circuits technologically generated electromagnetic fields and electrical circuits Wi-Fi phone communications this lethal stuff they're bringing in now which is actually a weapon called 5g are fundamentally impacting upon the electromagnetic fields of the body which affect people psychologically and which affect them quote physically and emotionally it's why you get so many people who are close to these that suffer from depression it's because they're being affected by the electromagnetic technological electromagnetic impact on their their field which expresses itself psychologically interest emotion in terms of physicality and the body's electromagnetic fields and when they're in a balanced harmonious state equal physical health a lack of disease disharmony when you start impacting upon the hot the the balance of that field you create disharmony and through that you get physical dis which is just an expression of electromagnetic disharmony disease causes disease this is what this is why people that that work or live close to these sources of electromagnetic energy with a phone towers or poor or whatever are so they get cancers that are very rare in the population because they have certain effects that go on this is why radiation is dangerous this is why radiation affects you and of course what we're living in now almost everywhere is a a permanent state of of walking living and breathing through electromagnetic technologically generated fields your fingers are cure for everything David hey do you think was a cure for everything of course there is yeah if everything can go wrong in Gori everything can go right it's just finding out what can go right and if you are the mainstream medical profession which is basically just an extension of the pharmaceutical industry it's all it is then you are not given the full range of possibility to treat disease disharmony you're given the scalpel and the drug in other words you're given a bloody hammer and you're told that every human problem be it psychological emotional or physical is a fricking nail and so oh what have you got Oh OMG rest Oh over here bang there you go you get you you'll get that at the drugstore what do you think goes on you know this is what happened because of the medical profession he's just another expression of the postage stamp consensus as I call it this narrow band of information that people not only believe in but are forced in terms of the medical profession to believe in because you want to I know people doctors who've realized that alternative methods of healing are better than what they do the scalpel in the drug they've been struck off for using them even though it benefits the patient because the pharmaceutical industry controls the medical profession this is this is why now we're seeing this war on the circulation of information challenging the official story of vaccines and this is why YouTube is de monetizing and deleting same with Amazon and Facebook information that's challenging the official story of vaccines one of the reasons in the immigration minister's diatribe in Australia saying why my visa is going to be revoked four hours before we plane that for Australia and like months and months after I was given it was my views on vaccines so and my views on climate change caused by humans which it isn't climb it's always freakin changed but that means that in Australia in a society that believes it's free you the pharmaceutical industry that makes billions and billions of pounds out of vaccines can say what it likes about vaccines but me for me me one-bedroom flat on the Isle of I can't go to Australia and give a different view now we're back to something else why why are is the Australian government which which is an asset of the pharmaceutical industry like all of them why is it so terrified of me why a doctor called sherry Tenpenny from America who is a big Challenger of vaccinations she was also banned from Australia now so you've got the vastness of the pharmaceutical industry that can advertise its products and vaccines on the television but they're terrified of a handful of people going to Australia and challenging that you know why cuz they can't win the debate and they're so aware they can't win the debate they're so aware it's a scam certainly at the pharmaceutical level that they have to shut up everybody even the smallest voice doing giving another view and my band from Australia has was a big wake-up call for Australians I think the the petition to get me in you know closing in on 20,000 now because it reminded them and put in their face Australia may seem to be a free country but it's not Britain may seem to be a free country it's not neither's America that these are illusions and they're terrified of other opinions of course they know that what they're trying to one to sell the public across the range of subjects is a load of old bollocks that will not stand up to factual scrutiny where do people get your books David David Icke calm they'll get it within to get them within 24 hours there's a lot of them the the the newest one is everything you need to know the rent on the note it's out now it's been out for a little while and you won sorry we're talking about that I've just I'm literally just finishing that I think safety fella that will be out probably in about three or four months but I've also got a film coming out which I was asked if they could they will make a film of my life it's called renegade seen the trailer over there yeah and that is we've got some premieres of that in Manchester and London and Los Angeles and New York the dates are on the on the website davidduke.com and I'll be attending all of them and are taking questions afterwards and the the movie itself will be available to to download from June the 4th and and it's about my life yes but my life is the theme the backbone but it's packed with information exposing the the whole scam so I'm hoping it will bring in a lot of new people to see the world he's not actually like we thought it was yeah excellent David for coming on my show and government your team it's been excellent and your viewers your boots you stand on stage but then I was like a team and gave your views and your knowledge it you've got is there anything you'd like to finish up on and to try and follow any but then they just rock well it's maybe trying awaken ourselves now maybe going through the same Jonathan that you went felt years ago and they're scared with advice would you give them or what would you say to read them to amoeba VCS that could maybe help them well what what transformed my life and what would transform anybody's life is to reassess their self-identity stop self identifying with labels stop saying that's who I am no no that's what you're experiencing what you are is the awareness the eternal state of awareness that is having the experience and if you come from that point of view the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and outrageous abuse and Twitter storms I like and but if you are dented by with the labels it becomes massive it becomes all-encompassing and I would say I would say this more than anything else and I'll say this to the kids okay the suicide of kids is just going through the frickin roof right in the social media era a lot of it if it is lack of self-respect coming from all the abuse and and all the impositions of what you should be and you're not good enough and you should be less and you're not remember that you are what you are and what you are now can be something else whenever you choose to become the totality of what you are instead of the little me that you think you are but if if you look at it the people who were abusing you who are ridiculing you who are telling you you're not good enough right well who the hell are they who are they who are they why do they matter I I can tell you from personal experience that people who abuse me years ago are now coming to my talks and reading my books because the thing the thing is that they'll think something else tomorrow that's for sure whatever they're saying now or they'll think something else tomorrow they'll say something else tomorrow but the point is the key point what the hell does it matter what they think about you what does it matter oh that person doesn't like it gives you a hard time well go find someone else then stop interacting with them go go go find some other people to interact with you know who are these people why are you allowing your life to be dictated by the opinions of other people you are unique no you're not like they are thank godoh most of the time so why are you worried about what they think why are you even worried if you get it down to two real basics what your parents think of you cuz you are what you are and you know for me the greatest gift you can give to your kids is to allow them to be what they are to allow them to go in the direction that they feel to go into instead of dictating to them the direction their life should take all you can't do that all you can't get that all what will the neighbors think I mean what will the neighbors think who cares no don't think what they like it doesn't matter and I'll tell you from experience it really doesn't matter what people say about you what people do about you what people think about you so long as you don't care it doesn't matter you didn't me you don't listen to people and say oh yeah I've got a point there maybe I'll look at that that's not the same thing it's it's being intimidated and being broken in spirit by what other people see you it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because anyone who's ever done anything in in the world look out all the way through history anyone who's made a real positive difference to the world is overwhelmingly faced ridicule and abuse before they were accepted to have been right all along majority get accepted after one day yeah exactly and if they had succumbed to fearing and responding to how people initially felt about them they would not have done what they did which was eventually accepted to be correct so when you're in a world a programmed world with such narrow programmed perceptions of reality if you stray beyond that you're gonna get laughed at you're gonna get ridiculed you're gonna get abused just so what it doesn't matter it only matters if you think it matters you know people abuse me thanks for sharing that with me have a nice day that's more a reflection on them though of course it is secure they lost its it's like we're talking earlier what I what I said you know every time we open our mouths we think we're making statements about other people we're not we make it a statements about ourselves every time we open our mouth and and people who go on social media and abuse other people behind the the the cowardice of login names is making a statement about themselves then they need to find themselves a mirror and maybe they have a chat with it and maybe they can realize that actually the statement is about them and not the people they're abusing their thing is not to care once you care about what other people think about you they have control of your life that'll be the frickin day yeah perfect David again met you've been absolute let's make a shot and for what you've achieved in the balls to keep carrying on and do what you do it take no problemo my cottage check out David's and stick around to our Facebook and YouTube channel don't meet your question I have a lot of stuff but again me it's been phenomenal and I wish all the best for the future the new book mmm it's been clear thank you thank you mate thank you brilliant "
going like this so max egan if you guys know who he is great researcher he did flat earth hated it he just thought it was the dumbest crap ever and he said i'm taking that flight why don't you guys track me and we're like let's do a live stream you when you get to the airport you can log in prove that you're getting on the plane we'll track it with flight software and then when you land you can log back into the live stream and we didn't you know we kept the live stream straight so no one could say that we did anything and what he did is he he um he did compass readings on the way and if the earth was a globe he should have been going south and coming around to to australia you know and then uh and then a little bit of um northwest to get to get there at the end after it comes up but that's not what happened that's not what he saw when he did it he he he had all of these readings and we charted his reading we said okay here's the path that he would take on a flat earth and all of these green lines are northwest this purple line here this one line right here that's the only time he'd be going west and then these other these yellow lines are southwest southwest southwest and then kind of south south is every direction away from the center and so we plotted them out on this and it made perfect sense it made no sense on a ball earth it made perfect sense on a flat earth right so the compass always has to point towards the center his compass readings made perfect sense on a flat earth right so these flights from australia to the united states prove you know or from taiwan from these southern you know these places out here they they just prove that the the earth is not a spinning ball whatsoever and so these these these uh these accidents happen they get reported in the news and then we have people that document them this book 16 emergency landings proving flat earth uh they documented 16 landings that made zero sense less than zero okay since on the globe earth but they all made perfect sense on a flat earth they have them all documented mapped out shows you what they look like on a flat earth you know you're in one place you're going from i don't know new york uh to moscow or whatever and there was an emergency and they landed like crazy places makes no sense on a ball none makes perfect sense on a flatter 
what's up my youtube family it's your boy roberto checking in with another conspiracy video guys so stick tight watch this video because i am about to talk about the new world order and how the republicans the reptilians and the demon democrats are starting to work together and how this means this is terrible news for the rest of the world and the united states so stay tuned and watch the video so in case you guys don't know the demon democrats and the reptilian republicans have been somewhat getting along like getting along and starting to agree with each other on certain topics the republicans are starting to change their views on certain things and the democrats are starting to change their views on certain things and the reason this is very important is not because we already know they divide the country intentionally between parties they have one they have you have your republican people you have your democrat people and then you have the people that are just very few people there just in between so now what they are doing because this is all the scheme this is all part of the plan these politicians quite frankly don't care about us and they probably never will care about us but the whole goal is to deceive us and divide us by having two different parties and making people hate each other one party has these agreements one party has these agreements in the end they have a big disagreement and guess what we the people pick parties so when our party doesn't agree with the other party we attack one party and guess what we do to those people that support that party we attacked them too well now what you're seeing is the republican the dem the republicans and the democrats trying to get along and this is all planned by them because they're working towards a one world government and this is the bad part this is why i say it's not good for us yes it may stop division within the country if the parties do start getting along and starting agreeing with each other yes on paper it does not look like they're agreeing because anytime they vote on something it's still the same thing but the disputing and the arguments are starting to calm down and they're starting to agree on certain topics a lot of topics they're starting to agree on and that is the scary part because they're planning this correctly they're going to start agreeing more they're going to make the people in the country think that we're starting to unify as a as a country as a whole the parties are starting to work together which is what they should be doing without trying to manipulate us but the only reason they're doing so is because they are working towards a new world order a one world government and in order for the united states to get this one world government and to get this new world order in place they have to get along they have to work as one they have to work as one party they can't be divided these politicians cannot be def divided and there's not no problem for them but they're trying to find a way to slowly get the american people to work together and to not be divided anymore so that when we take let me not say we when the american government takes over the world as the new world order the new one world government it won't be any division within the country the the country will be a team together and the government of the united states which will nine times out of ten be the leader global leader of the world because we already are the global leader of the world but we will to be the ultimate government of the world the president of the united states will be the president of the world so what they have to do is get us together and they're gonna divide all the other countries they're gonna put they're gonna they're gonna put more division within the other countries and the countries that are unified they're gonna break that up they're gonna break it up and the reason you don't want a one world government because everybody follows the same set of rules everybody answers to the same person everybody abides by the same laws and the scary part is it's gonna start turning into a dictatorship we're going to start seeing the president the most powerful person in the world become a dictator because the power is going to get to their head their american government is going to enjoy this power having control over the rest of the world this is what it's always been about it's controlling the world the united states has always been a controlling country wanting to butt into everybody's business wanting to control everybody's country wanted to control everybody's resources and if you don't listen to the united states they go to war with you and they take over that way the united states is moving one step closer to the new world order the elites know this the elites are pushing for it and once the united states decides to band together as a government they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna take over all the other governments they're gonna kill off leaders like kim jong-un vladimir putin they're gonna they're gonna take they're gonna go out to china's president but i'm pretty sure he'll take a step to the side because of fear so not only will the united states run the most powerful country in the world then number two more than likely the vice president to the united states president or the country of the united states will be china's president and we all know how that's gonna go the united states is going to implement strict rules on other countries we may see us going in reverse back towards another time slavery with the united states bullying other countries and using the other countries people the workers for hard labor guys the new world order is among us martial law will come into effect the united states will start putting people in fema cap fema camps this is not what you guys want this is not what you want and not only that united states is already greedy so countries that are already poor is gonna get milked of all their resources and not only that the countries that are rich right now not going to say necessarily rich but very strong economies are going to get milked by the united states united states government will take over the rest of the world they will make every country poorer they will make every world leader bow down to them they will strip countries of they have kings and queens they will strip them of the crown all the resources will be coming back to the united states yes we may be living good here but think about the rest of the world guys if we're getting much closer to a new world order martial law will come into effect military united states military will be in some of the streets of some of these countries forcing their citizens to abide by the laws y'all stay woke and watch as the united states government starts to band together they have a plan and the plan may hurt the rest of the world big time and this may be when the aliens decide to step in stay woke guys have a good day 
"this is a Reader's Digest version contending many of the interesting parts of the Flat Earth theory for those who have already started saying things with new eyes it will be mostly a recap but there could be a few new angles you haven't looked at for the rest of you who are new to this first question is invariably is this a joke because it's a joke right and that's where we start because it's one of our two basic childhood facts one plus one equals two and the earth is a globe or taught this before almost everything else and that right there should give you a clue on how serious the secret is but for those who have forgotten their history here's the modified men in black version for the first four thousand years of our civilization we believed that the earth was a flattish disk surrounded by a solid dome barrier called the firmament all the five major religions had their own version of this and the churches enforced the belief then around 1514 a man named Copernicus created a new model of the world he stated that if the earth was spinning around eleven hundred miles an hour and circling the Sun at sixty thousand miles an hour the world was then round and while the math more or less worked there was a problem it was 1,500 and the technology to prove such a theory wasn't there the first balloon to carry people wasn't invented until 1760 sailboats were the only travel over water and the fastest thing on land was a horse but the new world view was promoted and took hold the religions adapted to handle the new reality and life moved on more importantly the globe model was quickly introduced into the education systems over the next 500 years the challenges to this model faded to the point where the globe was accepted as universally as physical laws such as gravity read that again if you didn't absorb it for 20 generations people believed that the earth was round because there was a globe in every classroom they in there was no proof hundreds of years went by and still civilization had no way of proving the theory planes were invented around 1900 but until 1957 nothing could go high enough to give a true perspective of where we lived and that's when everything got strange the United States and Russia both sent up rockets high enough to take decent pictures and what they saw scared them a great deal how do we know they were extremely concerned about the sky because the US and Russia immediately started firing nuclear weapons straight up and they kept firing for the next four years a few things to keep in mind here first this was now 1958 nuclear weapons were very expensive and hard to come by these also weren't those nominal yield 20-kiloton toys we used on Hiroshima this was high kiloton too low Megaton and we couldn't get them up fast enough and the strangeness continued in other places in 1959 only a year into the atmosphere bombardment ten nations including the United States made Antarctica off-limits to any colonization a treaty was put in place and to this day remains intact over 50 nations now have signed off on this treaty do you know any treaty that has lasted that long between all industrialized nations moreover do you know any piece of real estate in the world that is owned by no one you would think the very least one of the large oil companies would use their huge financial resources to explore this region and yet they don't even petition the idea the short version of the discovery is this by 1958 the military had discovered the very solid upper and outer edges of our world and had to create a way to put up do not enter signs without looking obvious it was tricky but if there is one thing I have learned about the Authority it's that nothing is left to chance most of the work had already been done for them so their job was primarily in the details the sky part of the dome was much higher than commercial air traffic it's the only thing they had to worry about there was a space program which is immediately militarized the outer border had the natural benefit of not only an extensive ocean but a scaling decrease in temperature and a steady increase in iceberg frequency to discourage ships all leading to a permanently frozen landmass that could not be used for any form of agriculture this ocean and ice layout had worked well for thousands of years because the technology of the current civilization didn't evolve quickly sailors avoided cold weather seas whenever possible and oxygen levels get low enough to harm people even on high mountains the brilliance of the design comes in the simple fact that human males are corrupted by power corruption so total in fact that they would rather hide the world itself rather than risk their power on it you could theorize the kings and Pope's were told of the world a long time ago maybe an ancient scroll or book perhaps an interdimensional being told the tale of what the world looked like but this was all but dismissed because even the most powerful leaders of the day couldn't reach the borders and if they couldn't what chance to the general public have it's one thing to be told of the giant impenetrable dome but it's a whole different animal when you finally stand right next to it then the tough decisions have to be made do we keep the secret and how far we willing to go to keep the status quo once they decided to keep the secret no expense was spared the rapid progression of rocketry science had to be addressed quickly and so the moon missions were created Matt from the NASA Channel was right in his thinking that you needed the moon mission event to stage a picture of the Earth from deep orbit and that couldn't be more true establishing NASA as the front-runner of space exploration also diverted people who would have otherwise created their own space companies for profit the best engineers technicians and pilots were recruited to the NASA space program once there they were compartmentalized on a need-to-know basis the astronauts know of the deception and are sworn to secrecy under the penalty of whatever motivates them private space programs are discouraged sabotage or absorbed into the NASA fold private sector spacecraft are just not going to be allowed for several reasons the most obvious is the collision with the dome itself the telemetry data from such a mission would show an impact failure at a certain altitude and if repeated would raise questions NASA just isn't prepared to answer there are three perpetual questions about our world that can't be eliminated but avoided at all costs these are the questions you should ask yourself and others if this protective layer is going to be lifted I'd like to preface this with a thank you to Max Malone a conspiracy Hardcore who has a knack for boiling down debates to a single paragraph whenever possible it was he who said after over 50 years and thousands of hours of space travel footage both by NASA and other countries there is no exterior shot where the astronaut completes the simple act of panning the camera 180 degrees let alone a full 360 degree sweep this has never happened on any moon mission exterior space station nothing ever statistics will tell you this would have already happened by accident years ago but it hasn't and it won't this is because of the rule they cannot break the same rule that applies to television set shows that never show the fourth wall why because there is no fourth wall number two when you search online for pictures of the Earth from space 95% of what you will see is a collection of artificial composite shots in 2000 when I did this search there was exactly one picture by NASA showing the bottom part of Africa and Antarctica now that picture is hidden within hundreds of simulated images there are HD cameras everywhere and no one is taking a shot of the earth because you can't get enough altitude to do it number three the commercial air travel routes for the southern hemisphere are wrong this is an easy thing you can check out in 60 seconds take a map reading of the distance between anywhere near Australia and anywhere in South America it's a straight shot across the South Pacific now find your favourite travel site and try to get there non-stop see what happens the routes start turning ridiculous I used to business travel for years and I've never seen anything like it it's the one thing in the general public world they can't hide the actual distance between these two places on a round world the flight is easy just a straight shot across an ocean but on a flat world it becomes the greatest distance between two points there are no shortcuts so they distract you with multiple connections and lay overs it's only blind luck that the United States was in the northern hemisphere otherwise the increased traffic would have raised eyebrows by now I know I know it's madness it's lunacy there are people who will tell you straight to your face that all the leaders of the world are lizards and yet these people laugh out loud when you say the words Flat Earth I was and still am a huge conspiracy guy I literally ran out of new tin hat topics to research and I still wouldn't look at this one without embarrassment but every time I glanced at it there was something unresolved and once I saw the near perfection of the whole plan I was hooked do your own homework ask the questions get past the possibility and see if you can move into an even bigger picture like who built the dome and why that's where it starts to get really interesting and things start opening up I know I said years ago that the greater good was something that should be preserved that JFK Pearl Harbor and 9/11 were inevitable I still believe it and I understand the decisions the globe illusion however has run its course over the last 500 years it's time to start again if that means we end up getting the attention of who or what created this place and force the reset of the world is that such a bad thing I put some links in the description that you might want to check out like the current map projections used by the USGS the United Nations logo the Flat Earth Society high-altitude nuclear tests the Antarctica treaty among others I'm not allowing ratings or comments on this video for several reasons one this topic seems to bring out the worst debates because of the initial denial that and I've seen dedicated trolls in the Flat Earth Society website who show up every day and say the same thing to new forum members it's a joke it's not serious nothing to see here kind of strange that there are full-time trolls on a site that has less than 500 members worldwide that being said feel free to contact me at em sergeant 23 at Comcast net or heck just call three oh three four nine four six six three one I know no one uses the actual phone anymore but I'll answer what I can "
based on what they're showing us it seems very fake when we're being presented with things like the moon landing footage and you've only got to look at it with a critical eye to see that it's done on a set hi I'm Nathan Oakley and I'm a flat earther I run several YouTube channels I interview people about the subject and I've been doing it for about the last couple years in my last career I was traveling around the world as an international sales rep and as I traveled around the world what I observed on almost every flight was the same thing which was lots of people staring at the back of their head rests and observing the latest movie drinking booze falling asleep whereas I would actually be at the back of the plane looking at the emergency exit window which had the widest viewing angle and observing the flat plane below that being the case when I came across a map our land video on YouTube and he uttered the words flatter not in ridicule but in the same context as we are talking about today he immediately was a Eureka moment I mean I literally went and woke my wife up and told her that the earth was flat well NASA were developed for the sole purpose of lying to us their only purpose is to perpetuate the globe lie every single story that is told by NASA has the sub context that we live on a globe way they're faking things is with top-of-the-line absolutely cutting-edge studio techniques like we're used in the film gravity so they're using trapeze they're on high wires in order to fake us for as long as humanly possible well that's a good comparison because the blockbuster movies bolster the NASA fakery if you're watching guardians of the galaxy or Star Trek or Star Wars the basis of that is that you are on a spinning globe so the fact that Hollywood perpetuates this this meme this lie this spinning globe lie is the over-the-top suspension of disbelief whereas when NASA do it they play their cards much more closer to their chests they always keep it nice and simple so they're not going to having Star Wars type battles in space they're just going to have a zero-g meal it's much more downplayed the Illuminati um I don't know a great deal about the Illuminati it's something that I've come across since finding out the earth was splatter investigating Flat Earth it would seem that there are certainly families or bloodlines or secret societies that control certain aspects of our life however until 1972 we hadn't been up and checked so for to say that a secret society knew and was therefore prepared perpetuating a deception I would say no no I can't prove it I can only support it with evidence so to say do I need to prove it I would say no because the starting point is flat that's what you observe that's what I observe and that's what everyone deals with in their day-to-day lives prepared every insult Under the Sun and I think the reason we get these insults is because we are pre-programmed from birth to ridicule the idea of Flat Earth we're told that it's a notion of Philistines it's something that we have progressed beyond so I tend to not overreact to people who are insulting to me about the subject and try and ask them to either if they're very combative prove what they believe which is the globe or ask them to research Flat Earth well I've never been to the ends of the earth so it's a difficult one to give you an answer is the moon fake news no but does the moon have fake news surrounding it yes absolutely of all of the celestial bodies it's the one that would most indicate surface ferocity right word being spherical and therefore it's used by people like NASA to prop up the notion that we are live living on aids s fear also so it's used to perpetuate fake news do I get ridiculed now no doesn't seem to be the case a couple years on it's more like this people actually wanting to know more information about the subject to doing a be research themselves so I think it seems things have progressed I don't have an actual explanation for how the seasons work I don't know what the Sun is same technically goes for the moon I don't know what the moon is and further that I don't trust any of the maps that they give us absolutely it is fundamental to state of being is fundamental to our existence if we said they are right the perpetrators of the life you like are correct then we are absolutely and totally insignificant we are a speck of dust in a soup of nothing expanding into a massive infinite space of nothingness whereas the converse is that we are in an enclosed system therefore we're it 
every once in a while a photograph is taken that is not only disturbing but also incredibly unexplained and there are many out there that most of us are familiar with so hopefully there are a few in this list that aren't as common bar equally mysterious the Grand Canyon mystery man the exact date of when this image was shot is unknown but the person who posted it on the Internet said that it's sometime between the 1970s and 80s he said that his uncle took a trip to the Grand Canyon with some friends and like many they decided to take a picture on the edge of the canyon when they took the camera all to be developed they noticed a very eerie person in the background staring at the camera the man and his friends were in that spot for around 15 minutes and did not notice anyone in the area as the Grand Canyon was pretty quiet at that time of the year the person who posted the photo said that to this day his uncle swears that he or the photographer did not notice anyone nearby whilst taking the photo and have no clue who the man is and why he is hiding in the bushes he sure looks creepy though and people have pointed out how pale he looks and the fact he has his hood up and it might just be a camera illusion but he also looked a lot taller than the other man the biggest mystery of all though apart from the fact who is he is why was he there in the first place as you can imagine there are many theories and all are equally terrifying some believe the man was there to commit suicide but noticed people were coming over so hid in the bushes some say it's the Grim Reaper and others say he could have been waiting to push the man off the canyon thinking he was alone but noticed the cameraman and his friends and decided not to there is no way of knowing if the photograph is real or fake but it has been put through analysis and was confirmed that it hasn't been manipulated meaning if it is a fake then the person would have actually been there and not edited in after so what do you think the disappearance of Tara calico ok so I know this picture is quite frequently used but due to the disturbing and mysterious story behind it I cannot leave out they all started when 19-year old Tara calico sat out for a bike ride on the morning of September the 20th 1988 on a mother's pink mountain bike oddly enough she old her mother they she did not return by noon to come looking for her Tara didn't return Ana murder started searching tracing the route she knew her daughter had taken she did not find her daughter or the bike but found a Walkman cassette player similar to the one her daughter had been listening to and later searches finally cracked walkman cover also believed to belong to Tara her mother became convinced her daughter had been kidnapped but since Tara was legally an adult she had the right to disappear if she wanted to so apparently little could be done without evidence of a crime and despite efforts by a family the trial went cold Tara had disappeared into thin air and no one could help her family solve the case then on June 15 1989 a woman in Port Saint Jo Florida pulled off route 98 to pick up groceries from a food store she parked next to a white van and when she came out of the shop she found this harrowing Polaroid looking photograph beside her car he shows a girl and a young boy in what appears to be the back of a van and the thought of them possibly being in the van that was parked next to the lady who found this photo is truly horrendous the woman immediately alerted the police but Tara's mother did not become aware of the photo for a further two months when she seen the photograph she was sure it was a daughter although thinner and with no makeup a distinctive scar on her leg convinced her it was Tara initially the boy in the photograph was thought to be missing 9 year old Michael Henley but in 1990 Michaels remains were found not far from where he had disappeared two years earlier his death was ruled as a tragic accident and it was confirmed he was not the boy in the photograph Tara's mother searched tirelessly for a daughter up until the day she died in 2006 with the belief the girl in the Polaroid was a daughter and that she was still alive what gets me like I said is the thought of them possibly being in the white van that was parked next to the lady who found the photo in that car park we may never know what happened to the two people in the photograph but we can only hope that no harm came to them it's certainly a disturbing picture to look at and to date who kidnapped them what happened to them and the identity of the boy is sadly still unexplained edna cintron this next picture is very disturbing and illustrates the helplessness of the victims of 9/11 even though this woman appears to have survived the initial impact her chances of survival were very low I know I have already shown a photo from 911 in a previous video but when I seen this one I knew I had to include it although more disturbing than unexplained how the woman and also the man survived the initial impact of the plane is truly remarkable we know that the woman is believed to be a lady called Edna Cintron a 46 year old employee of Insurance Brokers marsh & mclennan but this has never been officially confirmed the photograph shows the area with a plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center a gaping hole of mangled steel and molten metal can be seen with the woman very visible and clinging to a severed pillar waving desperately it's incredible that's so near to the point of impact anybody was able to survive at all in that area it was reported at the time that telephone calls from victims confirmed that not all offices on the floors that were hit were destroyed immediately though and several of the trapped fell into cooler areas and the areas where the planes hit would have been the coolest of all as the impact points were sucking in fresh air maybe this lady thought there was a chance that she could be rescued if she got to a cooler area and could be seen with all the helicopters flying around maybe she thought she could have been winched to safety and it's believed that she was there for a considerable amount of time not knowing that the towers would eventually collapse like I said in my previous 911 photo it was truly a horrific event that should never have happened and my heart goes out to all of those innocent people who were taken too soon that day and I know many talk of conspiracies and such but when they do they seem to forget they are talking about an event that killed thousands and left even more families and friends without loved ones so just consider this when giving your opinions this next photo was taken near Zagreb in Croatia the location is popular with hikers and on the day the photo was taken the photographer was with several friends who were all taking photos and messing around but when looking through their pictures they noticed an eerie figure in the distance none of them recall seeing a person around whilst taking the photo and although it's a popular place on this today there were very few people around and even though bored deer and foxes roamed the woods this figure does not resemble any of them none of them can really explain the strange figure and it does not appear on any other photos the only explanation they could come up with is that it was someone who was I group hype who walked off from the group to pee in the woods with his back facing the camera but they still can't understand why they didn't see the person and pointed out that surely they would have at least heard the man if this was the case some people have said that the photo looks familiar to the mythical Slenderman who as most of us know is a terrifying thin very tall faceless man who tries to abduct people the photo has been put through analysis and it's not believed to have been tampered with and none of the group's seen or heard anything unusual on that day that they could link with the mysterious photo the cabin stalker this next photo is a lesser-known one but it's truly terrifying and caused a lot of debate when it was posted on reddit it was taken by a man who was staying any hunting cabin with some family in Michigan that was owned by a family member called Jill on the day it was taken most of the family had gone for a walk and only two of them were left in the cabin after a while one of them decided to take a panoramic photo on his phone of the cabin so he could show his girlfriend where he was staying but when he looked back at the photo he was shocked to see a figure lurking outside the window with what looks like a knife or weapon of some sort in his hand when the rest of the family returned to the cabin some three hours later and looked at the photo they seemed and concerned and even joked that it could have been the dead husband of the lady who owned the house after taking a look outside they discovered footprints leading from the woods behind the cabin to the exact spot where the figure was standing and if that's not creepy enough the next day when they showed the photo to the lady who owned the house she was convinced the man looked like a husband who had passed away a few years before when he was alive he would go out rabbit hunting in winter months and would return to the cabin carrying his catch and his rifle holding them in a similar way to the figure in the photo after they studied photos of her dead husband and compared them to the photo taken there was a definite resemblance in his posture and the bulky hunting gear he used to wear the person who took the photo does not believe in ghosts but has no clue what the figure is and since the family members who went for a walk did not return for a few hours after the photo was taken he is confident it wasn't one of them the photo has been put through a filter and does not show signs that it has been edited so what do you think is that the ghost of the owners husband some have even put forward that it could be the infamous mythical Michigan Dogman and others say that people robbed cabins like this so it could have been a robber who backed off when he noticed the cabin was occupied one thing's for sure though is pretty terrifying and leaves us with no definitive answers so let's five very unexplained and disturbing photographs I hope you've enjoyed and don't forget to send in any mysterious and unexplained photographs you may have thanks for watching and see you next week for another video 
good morning good afternoon or good evening beautiful humans i hope everyone's doing well on this beautiful eden plane depending on where you are uh peace love hugs support and all that wonderful natural and divine stuff uh open eyes ears most importantly an open mind in your search for truth and knowledge health and wellness which are one in the same today's video uh on uh 11 astronauts uh in the late 60s who uh died uh very mysteriously um and uh so on that note um enjoy the video and um i'll see you on the other side this is uh uh a next excerpt uh on uh gus grissom and other astronauts uh taken from ericdubay.com site and article here nassau moon and mars hoaxes all right uh before the first apollo mission uh ever even cleared the launch pad 11 nassau astronauts died in highly suspicious accidents gus grissom roger chaffee and ed white were all cremated together in an apollo capsule fire uh during a completely unnecessary and dangerous test where they were strapped down and locked into a hundred percent oxygen chamber which incinerated the three of them to death in seconds seven other astronauts ted freeman uh charles bassett elliott c russell rogers clifton williams michael adams and robert lawrence died in six separate airplane crashes and ed givens in a car crash eight of those deaths were in 1967 alone just a just a grand bloody coincidence right folks i mean come on what are the odds of probability that's ridiculous uh so many astronauts coincidentally dying under such circumstances is highly unlikely and leads credence to the idea that these were intentional hits by the masons trying to find the right people to sell their hoax one of the most outspoken of the fallen astronauts was gus grissom by 1967 grissom had become increasingly irritated and vocally negative about nassau's chances of ever landing man on the moon he stated the odds were pretty slim and famously hung a lemon on the apollo capsule after it repeatedly failed safety testing procedures uh grissom threatened to go public with his complaints about the lem and uh even told his wife betty if there ever is a serious accident in the space program it's likely to be me right after his murder government agents raided grissom's house before anyone had been informed about the fire or his death they removed all his personal papers and his diary never to be returned okay so here's a great article uh from 2017. uh gus grissom and apollo astronauts murdered in 67. hard evidence confirms astronaut gus grissom was murdered by nassau um the powers that be the rothschild cabal right like um nassau is just a another name and lair in the uh you know chaotic um web that they intentionally weave so they keep them themselves out of the line of fire uh so apollo astronaut was murdered sun charges uh this is uh christopher ruddy newsmax 2017. so virgil uh gus grissom the astronaut slated to be the first man to walk on the moon was murdered his son has charged in the february 16th edition of star magazine in another stunning development a lead nassau investigator has charged uh that the agency engaged in a cover-up uh of the true cause of the catastrophe that killed grissom and two other astronauts the tabloid exclusive by steve hers reports that scott grissom 48 has gone public with the family's long-held belief that their father was purposely killed during apollo 1. the january 27 1967 apollo 1 mission was a simulated launch in preparation for an actual lunar flight um we'll just laugh at that nassau concluded that the apollo 1 deaths of grissom as well as astronauts edward h white and roger chaffee were the result of an explosive fire that burst from the pure oxygen atmosphere of the space capsule nasa investigators could not identify what caused the spark but wrote the catastroph catastrophe off as an accident my father's death was no accident he was murdered grissom uh said scott grissom uh commercial pilot told star grissom said he recently was granted access to the charred capsule and discovered a fabricated metal plate located behind a control panel switch the switch controlled the capsule's electrical power source from an outside source to the ship's batteries grissom argues that the placement of the metal plate was an act of sabotage when one of the astronauts toggled the switch to transfer power to the ship's batteries a spark was created that ignited a fireball uh clark mcdonald a mcdonnell douglas engineer hired by nassau to investigate the fire offered corroborating evidence breaking more than three decades of silence mcdonald said he determined that an electrical short caused the changeover to battery power had sparked the fire he says that nassau destroyed the report uh just like they were destroyed all the evidence of the moon landings uh and destroyed all the technology that got them to the moon 50 years ago and they say it's too much of a process to rebuild it to get back to the moon that's the joke of the day folks okay i have apologized for 31 years about revealing the truth but i didn't want to hurt nassau's image or cause trouble mcdonald told the paper but i can't uh let one more day go by without the truth being known grissom's widow betty now 71 told star she agrees with her son's claim that her husband had been murdered i believe scott has found the key piece of evidence to prove nasa knew all along what really happened but covered up to to protect funding for the race to the moon which we all know is a joke uh scott grissom told uh star that the motor for his father's killing may have been related to nassau's desire not to have his father be the first man to walk on the moon see a little controlled opposition stuff going on here right because you know they're maintaining that you know um sounds like they're maintaining that the moon uh landing was real i'll be the first man to walk on the moon because of criticism leveled at grissom in 1961 after his gemini capsule liberty 7 sunk in the atlantic critics of grissom including novelist tom wolf have claimed that the astronaut panicked when his space capsule landed in the ocean and he prematurely pulled an explosive charge to open the ship's hatch causing it to sink fellow astronauts however gave grissom the benefit of the doubt for several reasons grissom was a decorated korean war pilot and had flown nearly 100 combat missions he was a courageous man not known to panic there was also evidence that the explosive device on the hatch could accidentally blow without being pulled a fact that led nasa to remove such devices from future spacecraft also had grissom pulled the explosive release on the hatch his hand or arm would have had powder or bruise marks neither were found grissom one of the original mercury seven was a senior astronaut uh when the apollo missions began among the astronauts grissom was the most critical of the problem-plagued apollo program and the main apollo con contractor north american aviation uh shortly before his death grissom had taken a large lemon and hung it around the space capsule as the press looked on he had suggested publicly the project could never be accomplished on time that was the you know when he did that that's when they just like they had probably made up their minds you know they're going to kill this guy the associated press reported pretty slim was the way grissom put his apollo chances of meeting its mission requirements the grissom family had reason to doubt the official nassau ruling from the beginning even before apollo grissom had received death threats which his family believed emanated from within the space program uh the threats were um serious enough that he was put under secret service protection and had uh been moved from his home to a secure safe house according to his wife grissom had warned that um if there ever was a serious accident from the space program it's likely to be me the apollo 1 disaster led to a series of congressional hearings into the incident the apollo 1 um disaster led to a series of congressional hearings into the incident and nassau during the hearings one launch pad inspector thomas baron sharply criticized nassau's handling of the incident and testified that the astronauts attempted to escape the capsule earlier than officially claimed uh baron was fired soon after giving his testimony and died along with his wife when his car was struck by a train authorities ruled the death as suicide yeah suicided uh during the congressional hearings senator walter mondale uh questioned the efficacy of manned space programs man space flights were opposed by many of the leading space scientists at the time including dr james uh vat allen and thomas gold okay so we'll just leave it here peace love hug support and all that wonderful natural and divine stuff um open eyes ears and most importantly open minds in your search for uh truth and knowledge health and wellness which are one and the same uh have yourselves a wonderful day folks and lots of love and please share um comment or like and subscribe that would be lovely so have yourselves a great day and we'll see you in the next video take care

out the New York Times trying to say oh look at this art exhibit and through the photos up themselves and giant spreads to try to hide it in plain view so I so so there was some creepy stuff at the pizza place there wasn't a basement like the News said mm-hmm we covered that there wasn't a basement so you did so so wait a minute you telling me that you went down to search for the tunnel and found nothing that's what you said Oh what I'm saying is that what you said that was no basement no they released you said there was nobody like you said there was no basement like the new city that's what you know where there is a basement no I didn't ask I'll tell you where there is I did not ask you where there was a basement I see it you just told me that there was no basement as they told us

really put the connection together that the montour project came off of the philadelphia experiment and there's even more that relates to the montauk project well quite a bit of stuff happened there yeah your mk ultra was going down there yeah um a water of your um weaponry um they say that uh um in alaska harp harp was actually thought of there they actually had a tulsa lab yeah but you know what i find interesting is that if you think of roswell you know like what else came off of roswell you know like we talked about the you know there was like uh different crashes that aztec i think crash and linda darnell and all that you know like you had all this stuff come off of these storylines you know this one actually there's like four or five different branches that come off of this so let's get into it talk about the montour project and the philadelphia experiment it's all based i don't give a soda's book fred the montauk project by preston nichols yeah you thumb through it i mean that i bought that book there was something on discovery channel talking about the montauk project and they were interviewing uh some of the people and you know it's like every channel now they have a ufo or paranormal show they do five six episodes and they never see them again they just get new people so it gave me the idea and i said well what's what's going on with this he he intertwines the uh the montauk story with nazism world war ii the only thing i don't like is that preston nichols he makes this statement in the beginning the book that says whether you view this as real or science fiction you know that makes me very leery if it's a true story why would you say that because you know when i write my books which are sci-fi i actually wanted to write one like that that was a diary that you found and say whether you believe this or not i see that's what you want to say because then they don't know what is real no apparently yeah you could be if you have something inside say for example ufo we say you can believe this is science fiction or that i mean yeah it's taken away from the ufo so you're not really believing it's a ufos you know well you know but so what happens is he writes and he says in the book that his verification is that uh he this is 1992 he wrote this he runs into this guy named duncan cameron and and that's after the thing ended in 83 but before his book that's the source of this information duncan cameron and his brother were on the philadelphia experiment right and they went back in time forward in time to 1983 you know and duncan jumped off the ship the brother stayed on the ship so when he came back there was only one brother they don't know what happened to duncan he was 40 years ahead in the future so when he makes his way out to montauk that's when he meets um preston nichols gives him this story and that's where the story comes from is now the verification for the story and he jumped off the eldridge was the show that was with the philadelphia experiment you know and he verifies a lot of the technology that you mentioned you know tesla technology all of that comes from this guy duncan cameron so this takes place on long island it's it's at the camp hero base which was an old world war ii air force base and they claimed that these experiments went on there from 1970 to 1983. okay so now i lived on long island i moved to long island in 1970 you know so that was interesting but this is was about 80 miles east of where i was living you know the guy that got uh is in jail out there where he lives did he live with somewhere uh four john ford yeah he live around that area you know he's not far actually he would be halfway between me and camp hero with john ford he was maybe 30 miles or 40 miles closer to this area than i have he's seen what he said he said well i think he definitely did see something and he got set up by the commissioners there because he was making waves you know so this is all consequence of the philadelphia experiment that went from philadelphia to norfolk virginia and came back in 1943 now what the philadelphia experiment was was a tesla cloaking device that we were trying to come up with a way to to our ships not be seen by the german ships and the german submarines so they were working on a way with tesla to cloak the ship tesla pulls out of this because he didn't really want anything to do with the military he just wanted to invent stuff you know so he pulls out so like i said the ship vanishes goes down to norfolk comes back to virginia a lot of the crew is missing that guy jumped others are actually fused into the hole some went insane because it really did something to their minds as they went through a dimension and the the technology that's linked to this the montoya project also has time travel right so it wasn't just cloaking and going to a different location it was time travel they went through like a portal or something right so uh now the information uh from uh about the philadelphia experiment obviously the military knew about it was their project and others but carlos allende contacts the navy and gives him this information which is this book here the case for the ufo now my book is case for the ufo his is the case for the ufo so i i obviously i definitely love the club and this is the viral edition which means it was printed by the viral company but it was the navy that printed the book so in this book it talks about extraterrestrials and all of that plus the philadelphia experiment so that's the book uh that you know it ends up getting written by uh morris jessup but the information comes from carlos allende right through the navy carlos isn't that the one that uh gorman talked to yeah i think so he was here in new kensington yeah he's from new kensington pennsylvania yeah so in that book there's all information about about uh aliens is is what it is so this guy boris jessup like a lot of these guys if you remember when we talked about uh frank scully and mr dr g you know dr g invented a way of tracking submarines well morris jessup is an astronomer he's the founder of the ymcas and uh he was an original ancient alien archaeologist he visited all of the ancient sites in the 40s and 50s and his books talked about that prior to eric von danigan he went to balbach cusco the pyramids he went to all of these places which is why the navy involved him and said look here are these letters we want you to figure this out is this real is it not real the stuff from allende right so so they get this guy a prominent person they give it to him the navy prints this stuff up uh from alende the philadelphia experiment is described in there too they give it to jessup to do the investigation in 1956. 1959 jessup commits suicide yeah and his notes well you know it's well that's yeah you know what his note said we are their cattle yeah we are their cattle so basically they can do anything they want to us but the funny thing is he commits suicide down in florida right and florida laura requires an autopsy no autopsies done and they said like what he did was he i think he plugged up the uh the exhaust with a wet rag and the tailpipe and stuff and they would they questioned people who looked at it said that wouldn't have worked and you know the way he did it he said that wouldn't have created enough to kill the guy and there was no autopsy ever done but in his mind with all he knew about the ancient alien stuff and sites this was enough for him to say that's it you know where their cattle we don't have free will they can do with us whatever they want and he kills himself now the guy with the pipe that's allende ten years later in 1969 allende who's from new kensington pa right here surprised how many of these people originated out of pennsylvania better believe it i'm stunned how many came out of pa you know even today linda moulton howe um lynn ketai there's a george knapp it's amazing how many of them came out of pennsylvania originally yeah well yeah so in 69 allende goes to apro which is a big group right our afros like nightcap and he gives them an affidavit notarized saying the philadelphia experiment was real okay now some of the notes out of the book say all science breaks down when confronted with the origin of man's intellectual development that's not evolution you know humans die due to gravity's wear and tear rocket propulsion will never solve space travel so i agree with that gravity ages us where if you were in space i don't think you'd age as quick and rocket technology is never going to get us where we want to go it's not going to get you out of the solar system with humans you know so that's not going to work you have to go faster than that they have and this is written now 50 years ago you know 60 years ago they have been here from the dawn of civilization man's ego is at stake i believe that you know because we wouldn't be the top predator then uh they will not allow humans humans to blow this planet up when it is the only one in a great distance which offers supplies and a haven for space travelers the moon is a recent acquisition of earth now people have said that if you look at the the milky way galaxy right that's my hand the earth is like right here on the outer edge from the center of it so if you needed to go from the middle from the middle to here you could refuel restock supplies and then leave the milky way galaxy because that's where we're located so there's a lot true about what this guy says you know and we know that the moon is nearly twice the age of the earth right so it came from somewhere else did it was it man-made or was it really who knows they got stationed there one way or another i find that whole story to be incredible also you know uh there are two distinct species that have come here and they live in the ocean and and in space they can go in space well think about if you can fly in space you can go underwater you know because of your airtight and you have some sort of technology that parts the electrons and parts the oceans and stuff you know or space and you don't get hit with debris out in space meteors right they're small in stature with four fingers there's good ones there are evil ones the open seas are a natural home for them and provide an easy catching place of men and fish okay so because because the men are out there on these on these boats right the deep space is not for every man sailors can make the long voyage so they are kidnapped think about that if you're on a ship for months back then you know you're used to this confinement and loneliness so their thinking is we're going to take sailors who are used to the confinement and the loneliness they're the ones we're going to kidnap for this long trip in space it's kind of interesting to think of that you know a diseased person once taken may not be desirable and is dropped off you know remember the species movie in 1995 with natasha henstridge species she was that alien and she goes and there's the guy and she goes back to his apartment but there's bottles of insulin and she she senses he's there's a disease she left because he he had an abnormality you know that that was cool and that's what he's talking about if you were a perfect genetic specimen they didn't want you and you know a lot of times like fish fall from the sky no i mean people have said they want to take shark so they catch other stuff in the net so in the ship they sort through they throw the rest out and boom that's what lands where how do these things just fall from the sky you know really it's not tornadoes you know that's what they say yeah but i don't believe that you know so uh humans love to impose their will and make war we learned not to war they went home after a war involving small asteroids as weapons and the remnants are under the sea so what they were doing and i think you see this in the mahabharata in indian india they talk about a war that took place in the sky so but what he's saying is they would take meteors and small rocks and asteroids and that's what they would redirect because you think about it if you are based on earth and they can shoot a half-mile asteroid you take out the size of texas yeah so there was some sort of a war that took place you know with either smaller meteors or or asteroids i mean the whole thing if nothing else is extremely creative and jessup it was too much for him to handle when he got this additional information from allende he committed suicide you know so so that's the philadelphia experiment right but what comes from it is the montauk project in 1970 you know 27 years later they were doing experiments they had this chair and they would put you in hook you up and everything it was called the montauk chair and from your thoughts you could create things if you certain people had the ability so you could sit and think and this bottle of alcohol if this is what you want to do or white label boom there it is with your drink but they had this chair they said you could create through the chair one of the things that comes out from this a beast from the unconsciousness of one of the people in the chair i guess if you're not a perfectly stable person this guy is thinking or he's got a real something wrong with him you know so this beast comes from his subconscious this is a real picture this is a picture of what they took there at montauk of this dark shadow thing it kind of looks a little bit like a bigfoot maybe you know it kind of does you know but it the only thing i don't like about this storyline is this is what happened in the movie forbidden planet remember from the conscious the thoughts they created this creature that came and killed everything and but so it's are they copying it or is it real you know i don't know but that was my first thought when they started talking about bringing something through your consciousness that they're talking that was the forbidden planet movie you know they also said that they were able to open up time portals they were able to control it they could go ahead in time they could go back in time they were creating time travel is what they were doing but i think if you went back in time our version now doesn't change i think it just splits into another version of us if you go back and change something i don't know i mean there is no way of knowing what happens you know but the whole concept of time travel really came from h.g wells in his 1894 book the time machine right which was one of the greatest movies you know this was a good movie from the 60s 1960s was the time machine rod taylor he passed away last year rod taylor was the actor but what they said took place from 1970 to 83 thousands of males between 10 and 16 were taken they were taken to the future as slaves or soldiers and he says in his book that it was very similar to the movie total recall so the schwarzenegger movie with mars and and the travel and the time travel was very similar to what they were doing there so you could see how this this philadelphia experiment montauk project you know it gives you all these branches come off of it like total recall now like i said when i moved to long island in 1970 i was 13. so 10 to 16 years old but i never had any of these type of experiments experiences or anything like that uh you know it's funny one time i had a paper route and i had paper out until 11th grade i would you know i loved doing my paper up and it was like 25 a week i'd make and it took me a half hour you know it was nothing uh one summer my two friends and i biked to montauk point you know we didn't know about camp here we got there we stayed one night we went back this was about an 80 mile trip each direction on bike about about two-thirds of the way back i look around did my friends are laying on the side of the road they couldn't make it i had a paper on it so i was able to do it you know the father came picked us all up took us back you know but i remember we were walking around our arms our legs was like so sore from doing it but we went out to montreal point by bike and i think that was 1973 i was 16. so what he talks about is the nature of time and what he says is that we're pawns cattle right like on a chess board the example he gives is that the greek like the greek greek and roman gods like with troy if you remember how the gods would say we're going to do this when they just move the chess piece and you know and then achilles is fighting hermes right you know right right i think that goes on yeah i mean it does seem like like the matrix like somebody puts a program in and things change you know or or my belief is we have free will these things are done to see what choice you make but some things are actually done and it changes you can't do anything about it that's going to happen you know but it's to teach you lessons you know i don't know but that's my view is that it's all about free will and lessons to be learned in this lifetime you know so that takes me to now this whole thing going on with tom belong right if you read what he says right and he he created that to the stars academy of arts and science right he does his broadcast he says that if you listen to it i watched it a couple of times he says they have advanced high-speed craft that can move through water like what they were talking about and through time that you could be holding this glass right with this device you see here they can take that glass from you and you would where did it go and here it is on a small level is what tom delong says they have some technology now that is high speed and moves through time again like the matrix like you know how he was able to move while everybody else was in slow motion that's what he's talking about that he has that they've acquired this technology he says he's he got it from the government from the department of defense is where he got it from because they released those videos to him so that's so so here you got this montauk philadelphia experiment montauk project time travel you know total recall tom delong's you know there are a lot of branches come off of this the the you know this guy committing suicide allende i mean there's this is this case i never realized i mean the philadelphia experiment i saw the movie i never paid a whole lot of attention to it tesla technology there was a ton and that's not it wait do you see this so i watch stranger things and i'm telling her when they said mk ultra in this i started telling the kids all about what i knew with mk ultra but then i'm thinking this is set in 1983. i watch season two and i'm saying to myself something here is clicking there's more to stranger things than than just what you're seeing i go online and i s and i'm looking up now the origin of stranger things is what i what i googled you know what was what was behind this show there it is stranger things was originally said to be filmed or based on montauk point long island it had to do with the mud talk experiment it was unbelievable because if you look at it right now what they do stranger things is set in indiana in 1983 and then i think of member erie indiana what the showdown was on so they did it in indiana originally was supposed to be on montauk long island if you look at what they do they got the base there i remember what i don't know what they call it base henry or something whatever there's a base but that is the montauk base mk ultra is involved just like the montauk project one of the there's a group of kids pre early teens one boy disappears a girl escapes from the base and she's got all these powers the mk ultra and stuff they were working on there were creatures like the creature that came from the the chair the mind you have that uh government facility that works on animals right by her too yeah you're right what was it called i can't remember what that is that's where they created lyme disease and it got out yeah brookhaven lamps i think it's brookhaven labs well we'll look it up we'll figure it out but you're right there's a facility very close to this who creates viruses and stuff with animals but lyme's disease escaped from that lab and that's how it's all over the northeast now came out of that lab near that it might even be the same one but you know they're talking about creatures into dementia travel this girl the kid this is everything from stranger things so stranger things came from the montoya project i knew there was something about this show that was just i said you know there's something here there's more to this show and you can actually go online and look this stuff up well people watching the show are seeing it from us but there there are some youtube videos out there talking about this now so uh you know that that's our show on on the montoya project philadelphia experiment anything else that it brings to mind with you fred i mean to me i guess i think i think the government has a facility like that still oh they do i mean you know like you're saying the mk alter that's still going on you know people don't believe it um the government can do things today that far beyond our comprehension because like i say i mean you'd be sitting in your house and they were there well you know one other thing you know you say about they're taking them to mars okay now again you look at pilates these young kids miss them and everybody's missing they're not old people they're very young yeah where are they going yeah well we'll get this two points before they go out of my head uh two points one bill clinton apologize for mk ultra there's video out there he got up there what's his name jumped out of the window yeah he says this took place and he that's out there bill clinton apologized so it didn't happen the other thing i'm watching a x-files the originals they're on tv now i'm sitting there watching it and i think the show was called unit 731 which is the japanese experiments on the chinese yeah in that episode scully is saying all these memories they were all being taken and they had these deformed people and it was that box car and they were all full there was a pit full of bodies they were taking the kids that's the montauk project that's where all the kids go are these government experiments or they take homeless people that are not going to be missed or i'm going to tell you another thing david say for example you have a kid and you they terminate your parental rights you're blank now you're nobody you're just a body there you have no name and no relative yeah they can do whatever they want to do well you know they said with project serpo that um like people you know would have had that exchange program with the with the ets from roswell we sent 12 of ours for only one of theirs which i find hard to believe 12 for one but what they said in that book project cervo was it's not that hard to find people in the military whose parents have passed away and they had no brothers or sisters think about it you're on your own at that point that's who they target not only that that's where you get your abductions why are they doing the abductions from the 40s okay is it really e.t doing abductions and taking us or is it our military yeah and we're pretending we're e2 you know you would be surprised when i watched like the x-files the old ones a lot of the things we talk about a lot of the theories now 20 years ago they were hitting on every one of those in that show very subtle they talked about it very subtle and but the new show that's out right now is very conspiracy based yeah you know and i think they're going to hit it real hard and they actually show aliens they showed the moon landing fake baby daddy is the uh yeah yeah yeah remember i put that on facebook you you replied to that yeah maybe that is the worst well it turns out the smoking man is now the kid's father no not mulder older father and yeah mold yeah the smoking man is oldest father and scully's the baby the baby's father and the one uh kershak or whatever yeah yeah yeah that's his dad too yeah they're all related to the smoking man so unbelievable but there was so much in though so you know in my mind a lot some cases are just a one thing i'll give you an example i was going to say ketchberg was a one-off right but do you know what uh my partner on that owen idler called me last week and he said i just discovered something i said what he goes remember 1968 night of the living dead pittsburgh he said what turned them into the zombies it was based on the kecksburg crash it was either the radiation or it was a virus brought in from space from kecksburg the crash created the zombie thing in pittsburgh i never knew that but but there you go no so so i don't know so uh i hear the cuckoo clock that's our show and we'll see you next time finish your drink fred we're done 
"You are watching Coldfusion TV Welcome to another Coldfusion video I'm going to start this video off with a quote. Henry Ford once said: It is well enough that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system for if they did I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning. I quote this because it encapsulates the fact that the contents of this video may be unsettling compared to the videos that i normally make. I still feel compelled to make this video because I've been exploring the financial world for the last four years and it has definitely given me a more complete view of the world. I want to share some of what i've come across with you guys I'm also going to do a video about crypto-currencies like Bitcoin in the future and to understand why Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies may continue to rise, it's critical that you understand the contents of this video. I hope that you find this topic interesting and that it inspires you to do your own research afterwards. Now, with that said, let's begin. So who controls all of our money? It's a simple question! We all know that you and I don't control it. Our employees don't controll it. The companies that they work for don't control it. So who does? Where does it even come from in the first place? I'll give you a hint. Money does NOT come from the government It's a seemingly obvious question that's never asked or taught in schools for some reason. Unfortunately, most people's lives are basically dedicated to money. It's all people ever worry about or talk about. We go to school to learn basically how to go to university, to learn the skills to get a good job so that we can trade hours of our lives all for this thing called money . So why wouldn't you want to know where money comes from and who issues it? Today, in this very special video, you're about to find out the answers to the question of Who controls all of our money? People today can tell something isn't quite right with our financial system, but they just can't put their finger on it. Some people think it's the failure of government, others think that it's the failure of the capitalism itself This video should clarify a few things. The year is 1694 andEngland had just suffered through 50 years of war. Exhausted, the English government needed loans to fund their political means. Brainchild of Scottish banker William Paterson, it was decided that a privately owned bank that could issue the money to the government out of thin air was to be the solution. This was the very first modern central banking system in the world. Central banking is more influential than laws, governments and politicians, but strangely not the focus of the general public. Fast forward to the early 20th century, and after two failed attempts a group of bankers wanted to put a central bank in the United States of America. It was December of 1910 and senator Nelson Aldrich boarded a private train car in New York with six others. The six were not to be spotted by any news reporters to avoid questions. Their destination: Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia. The meeting went for nine days and from that they created the Federal Reserve System. This is all documented and a matter of public record. Some of them went on to write about the meetings in their personal biographies. Here is a quote from Frank Vanderlip, president of the National City Bank of New York February 9th 1935 in the Saturday Evening Post: I was as secretive - indeed, as furtive - as any conspirator. Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted If it were to be exposed that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress. The six men that Nelson Aldrich brought together included the head of banks, branches of government such as the Treasury and some of the richest people on Earth at the time. To give you an idea of how rich they were in 1910 these six men represented a quarter of the world's worth. The bankers told the American public that the purpose of the system was to stabilize the economy and to stop the grip of the Wall Street banks over America. The problem was the guys that wrote the bill were the very same people they said they'd stop. If they succeeded, it would give a small group of men the ability to create money from nothing and loan it to the American government with interest. So why was it done in secret? Because the American people didn't want a central bank. Back then, unlike today, people knew what central banks were and understood them very well. Everywhere a central bank went, there would be wealth inequality, wild swings between economic booms and busts and after each bust, those in the top of society mysteriously came out richer, while everyone else got poorer. Europe was a running example of this at the time. The Federal Reserve was originally drafted as the 'Aldrich bill', but when it came into Congress, they recognized Senator Aldrich's name and smelled a rat. The bankers needed better cover. They decided to send two millionaire friends to carry the bill to quell the suspicions of Congress and renamed it The Federal Reserve Act . Next in this textbook lesson of deceit the bankers set out to fool the American people through disinformation. In the newspapers of the day the bankers screamed and protested against the new Federal Reserve bill. It would ruin the banks! they exclaimed. The average person read the protesting articles of the bankers and thought to themselves: If the bankers hate it, it must be good and then they ended up unknowingly supporting a Trojan horse. The bankers also fooled Congress by putting clauses in the bill that limited their power only to remove them once the bill was passed. A double head fake of the public and Congress - was all it took. The bill was passed on December 23rd 1913 while most of Congress was out on holiday. And with that, a small group had complete monopoly over the issuing and creation of American money. Today the Federal Reserve is the most powerful entity in the United States and they're not ashamed to admit it either. Here is former Fed Chairman, Alan Greenspan. What should be the proper relationship between the chairman of the Fed and a President of the United States? Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take. What the relationships are don't frankly matter. In addition to this, it seems that the Fed can't even be touched by investigating parties. So I'm asking you if your agency has in fact, according to Bloomberg, extended nine trillion dollars in credit, which, by the way, works out to 30,000 dollars to every single man woman and child in this country. I'd like to know: if you're not responsible for investigating that, who is? We actually have responsibility for the Federal Reserve's programs and operations to conduct audits and investigations in that area. In terms of who's responsible for investigating . Would you mind repeating the question one more time? Mr. Chairman my time is up, but I have to tell you honestly I am shocked to find out that nobody at the Federal Reserve, including Inspector General is keeping track of this. So what does all of this have to do with me? you might be asking. I don't even live in the US Well, two reasons. Number one: the central banking model from the Bank of England and the United States has now been put in all countries and even consolidated power in parts of Europe as the European Central Bank or ECB This unites separate countries under one economic policy. The only places in the world that don't have central banks are North Korea, Iran and Cuba. In 2000 this list suspiciously included Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. And number two: since the end of World War II, the US dollar has been the reserve currency of the world. This means that all central banks hold US dollars in their reserves. In other words all other currencies are backed by the US dollar. This directly links to your country to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy in America. More on this later. When the post- World War II monetary system, called the Bretton Woods system, was created, all US dollars were backed by and exchangeable for gold. A byproduct of this was that currencies used to be very stable in relation to each other. For that, all the countries, the exchange rates were fixed and year after year you could predict what prices were going to be. You could start a business elsewhere, you could calculate profits, business was much easier before floating exchange rates. Unfortunately, in 1971, due to a falling US dollar, international capital flows into gold and the funding of the Vietnam War, President Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard. I have directed secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets. Now the dollar was floating and backed by nothing and has been ever since. So let's think a little: if the US dollar is backed by nothing but the world reserves are backed by the US dollar intrinsically since 1971, doesn't this mean that all currencies are now backed by nothing tangible, only trust in the American government? Well, this is correct! Money backed by nothing is known as fiat currency . Fiat in Latin means let it be done . In other words, the government says it is money, so it is. A consequence to having money backed by nothing is that whenever the Federal Reserve creates money it dilutes the currency supply of all other nations because their reserves are backed by the US dollar. All countries' reserves are worth less each time money is created. In the past few years the Federal Reserve has printed trillions of dollars and countries like Russia and China have noticed this. As a reaction to the money printing, these countries have been selling US dollar reserves and buying gold over the same period. But wait a second! Some of you clever thinkers out there may have asked yourselves: If every currency on Earth is backed by nothing, how am i able to pay for things? Well, as it turns out, the whole economic system today is running because it is backed by faith. Faith that you can exchange your unit of currency for goods or services. In a way, part of that faith comes from the fact that not many people actually know where money comes from. We're about to find that out in this video. A central bank is essentially the entity that manages a nation's money supply and it can loan money to the government with interest. In the United States and most other countries it works like this: When the government needs more money than they received from taxes they ask the Treasury Department for money. The Treasury then receives an IOU or bond from the government. The Treasury, through the banks, gives this IOU to the Federal Reserve. The Fed then writes a check for this IOU and hands it to the banks. At this exchange at the banks, money is created and it can be used to pay government bills. So hang on! Where does the Fed get the money to be able to write this check? They get this money from nowhere! They literally just invent it. Here's a quote from the Boston Federal Reserve: When you or I write a check there must be sufficient funds in our account to cover the check. But when the Federal Reserve writes a check, there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money . So, in essence, they're writing a check and creating money from an account that has no money in it. The money the Federal Reserve creates can be used as legal tender to buy things and eventually makes its way into the real economy. If you and I did that, we would go to jail for fraud, but they can do it because they invented the system. This is the same system used throughout the world today Another part of this money creation happens at the commercial bank side. Every time you take out a loan to buy a house, car or TV, banks create money out of nowhere to give you this loan and you still have to pay interest on it. And don't just believe me when I say that. Hear it for yourself from the horse's mouth, the people running the system, Graham Towers, former governor of the Central Bank of Canada states: Each and every time a bank makes a loan, new credit is created. New deposits. Brand new money. Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England: Banks extend credit by simply increasing the borrowing customers' current account. So what they're basically saying is that each time the bank makes a loan, the bank doesn't use other people's deposited money and give it to you. It creates new money. In modern times this means typing digits into a computer. 97% of all money is digitally created like this. Only 3% is the physical cash and coins that we carry. Another crazy thing that commercial banks can do is lend out 10 times more money than they actually have in reserves. This is called fractional reserve lending. So who wrote this ridiculous system into law? For the United States, it was part of the Federal Reserve System drafted in 1913. And again, this is the same system used throughout the world. So what's the issue? Why should I even care? Well there's consequences. When more loans are given out more money is created and the rest of the money in circulation is worth less and less as the years go on. This is known as inflation. In a way, inflation is basically a tax that we all pay for the fraud of money printing. Easy money now in exchange for tax on our future generations. It's also why in 1950 a house used to cost $7,000 and a car $2000. Obviously, this is no longer the same today. Things will always keep getting more expensive as long as this system is in place. This was actually kind of OK because wages grew in relation to inflation until about 2008. Why this stopped happening is a story for another day. So things are already pretty crazy, but they get even crazier. The more you look into it, the stranger things become. So remember we were talking about how central banks and commercial banks can create money out of nothing This procedure actually does create something. It creates debt. Let me explain: When you take out a loan, it's written down as an asset in the bank as a negative form, kind of like a negative value of money, or otherwise known as debt . Under this system, debt is actually money. And again, don't just listen to me. Marriner Eccles, former Governor of the Federal Reserve states: If there are no debts in our money system, there wouldn't be any money. So, in essence, instead of gold being the backbone of our economy, it is now debt. The system we're under now is sometimes referred to as the debt based monetary system . It requires that debt always grows. Countries and people must become deeper in debt so that there's more money in the system, because, remember, debt is money. If people and governments stopped borrowing money and paper clones, the debt doesn't grow, the money supply shrinks and the system falters. It truly is bizarre, but we all live in this system each and every day. The Federal Reserve and other central banks control money by adjusting its supply and how much it costs to borrow money, otherwise known as the interest rate. With these tools and as a consequence of human group psychology, central banks create booms and busts in the economy at will and also to stall and derail an economy by messing with it. Let's take a quick case study. In the year 2000, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cut interest rates to 1%. He did this to try and fight off the recession from the dot-com bubble and encourage people to borrow money. When interest rates are low, if you're borrowing money you save a whole lot on repaying mortgages. Since the 1% interest rate hadn't been seen at the time since the 1950s it was a pretty good deal. Greenspan's idea was that he could create a wealth effect. People would start to buy houses, the prices would go up and the people would feel wealthier and spend more money in the economy and stimulated. Greenspan's sure succeeded in getting people to borrow money to buy houses. But they borrowed too much and the results was the 2008 housing bubble. This is a prime example of what can go wrong when central banks mess with an economy. Yes, corrupt bankers have a lot to answer for on their role in the 2008 crisis. But the Fed has a far bigger long-term impact. Even crazier things are happening in Japan. Their central bank is buying so many stocks that they were the number one buyer of Japanese stocks in 2016 so they have part ownership of companies with money that they created from nothing. So, in essence, it is the central banks that control our economy and the central and commercial banking system together that control all of our money. The difference is central banks can create money at will while commercial banks need loans to create money. To give you an idea of people's views of central banking when people actually knew what central banks were, here's a couple of examples. In 1881 then, President of the United States, James Garfield states: Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate. Benjamin Franklin, in his autobiography, stated that the prime reason for the American War of Independence was a battle over who actually controlled and issued the money of the new colonies. Moving on to more modern times, Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman states: The Federal Reserve definitely caused The Great Depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933. So, with all this being said, some would argue that central banks are not inherently a bad thing. They just need to be part of the government and not privately-owned. The government should be able to issue its own money for the benefit of the people and shouldn't have to pay a massive interest on its own debt. This was tried at least once in the United States by President Lincoln. He stated this: The government should create, issue and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers. By the adoption of these principles, the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest. Money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity. Abraham Lincoln then issued his own government money. It was called the greenback . No further comments on that story. So I think we'll end the video there. There's so much more that I could cover about what central banking decisions led to what revolutions around the world. Pretty much when you look at it, all revolutions and all wars, when you dig through everything, it all boils down to money. I could also have talked about the new global movement of those who are rejecting the debt based economic system. People are starting to move their currency into gold, silver and crypto-currencies like Bitcoin. So there is a light at the end of the tunnel. That's a whole nother story for another day. Anyways, if you've watched the whole way through this video, congratulations! You're one of the few who have found out the hidden truths about who controls all of our money. I think I've only met about four people in real life that have been aware of the debt-based economic system. It's strangely unknown, but it's as true as anything. I haven't showed you all the quotes of the bankers and the former heads of the Federal Reserve telling you from their own mouths how the system actually works. If this is your first time hearing all of this, I encourage you, as I said before, to do your own research and then you'll start to see the bigger picture and the world today will make a whole lot more sense. If you want some good starting resources, I recommend Mike Maloney's Hidden Secrets of Money series. It's here on YouTube and I'll leave a link below. Mike is a very knowledgeable guy and I've had some great long conversations with him about the economy. If you're into reading and you want to know more about the history of the Federal Reserve, I recommend the book by G. Edward Griffin, The Creature From Jekyll Island . So anyway, I think I'll stop talking now. Thanks for watching this video! It's a been too go go ? You've been watching ColdFusion. Feel free to subscribe to this channel if you're new. This isn't the stuff I normally make, but I think you'll like the other stuff anyway. I really hope you learned something from this video and I'll see you again soon for the next video. Cheers guys, have a good one! "
we know that reagan really didn't respond to aids during the first five or six years of his administration even though in 1981 scientific evidence came out that we had an epidemic on our hands reagan really didn't resources to the medical research in this epidemic and really hasn't done too much until recently he now has his testing programs but he's never really responded to it as a medical problem is there any evidence that the cia or some reaganites might be involved in the origin of aids that first didn't really appear until around 1981 is this the sort of virus that can be concocted by chemicals or some sort of biological warfare techniques well there are articles have been written by doctors saying that this thing smells of a man-made virus and mentioning this fort dietrich where so many experimentations have been done and and devising uh biological uh warfare and the diseases that can be controlled can be used on society no evidence has come out nothing that can be cited as proof and so we can only raise the question and i i have the feeling that if there is evidence somewhere if there was it's been destroyed another suggestion not cia and mind you in the context the fort dietrich experimentation in the context of the mk ultra program of experimenting on the american people with disease and drugs in over 200 medical schools and mental hospitals a big program that went on a long time supposedly closed down by the cia by the cia also the army was involved but a lot of the the navy's activities the navy was just covered for the cia but uh experimenting on population centers with whooping cough viruses with other kinds of viruses dragging a barge through san francisco bay leaking a flu type virus to measure that technique for crippling a city apparently using swine fever virus which is very much aid similar to wipe out the hog population in cuba in 1961 you know you add these things up and we have every reason to ask if this is not either a deliberate or an experiment or testing or something that's gone awry done by the cia another possibility the london times on the 11th of may had an article sourcing a high official in the world health organization who claims that they had documents he brought out documentation apparently that aids was triggered by a smallpox inoculation programs of the world health organization and presenting all kinds of massive documentation the countries where it's hit the worst where where they had the massive smallpox inoculations and then of course once it you know apparently takes on a life of its own the history will have to judge some of these things uh horrifying as aids is it primarily the victims the 25 000 who've died in this country so far are homosexuals and and drug users introvert you know the needle exchange horrifying as this is nevertheless it's limited to one segment of the society and it's a drop in the bucket uh compared to some of our major health program problems uh what 800 000 people die each year from smoking related illnesses and there is no great furor about that and that's 800 000 per year 55 000 a year dying on the highways a lot of them from drunken driving you know accidents and problems and there's no big furore about that in millions of cancer cancer which is also uh at least to some extent human made or produced um from the pollution of the revolutions and additives and preservatives and the furor on aids uh it seems you know it's clearly now of course the argument is that well it's potential for growth you know there's 75 million people that have it in africa today and and you know like numbers here and there'll be 10 or 15 million now history will show us whether or not that's true whether it it spreads like that well these articles you're talking about then do they discount the stories that aids started in africa with and spread to the rest of the world well the stories that i've read indicate that africa and haiti were the first places where epidemics of aids were found and then the male homosexual and drug using population of the u.s so the speculation is that if it was the product of some berserk experiment or some accidental thing like a smallpox vaccination program going berserk it was then imported to the target population of gay men in the u.s by someone who wanted uh to carry out a vendetta against them well this is the speculation that charge was raised uh by toss for example in in 1983 and and some of the more extreme magazines here in the states brought it up and i that struck me as cheap shot stuff uh for one thing the cia simply was not uptight about homosexuality the fbi was because hoover was a closet homosexual of the kind that that you know would would roll other homosexual persecuted other homosexuals and the fbi uh he had it very uptight about its homosexuality the cia just simply wasn't a big factor and certainly not enough for the cia to become you know to launch a complicated perhaps uncontrollable program to exterminate gays what about renegade factions of either the cia or the state department who heard that there was some virus that was used in some sort of chemical warfare that had been tested in africa and was found in haiti and found to be highly effective and some renegades got their hands on this and used it as a sort of berserk vendetta is there any plausibility in this kind of scenario i have grave problems with it uh in the cia and the state department although you know if a renegade faction could be two or three individuals you know who knows the the segment of society that has delighted the most uh of course is nixon's moral majority the jerry falwell you know it's clearly god's punishment and uh you know whether they would have had someone who could have brought out a disease this is pure speculation and and i must say the kind that does not draw me so much because we have so much i mean you have to keep your mind open to possibilities like that because so much stuff has come out where we were saying now i couldn't be or not likely and then later on you find absolutely they were doing it the experimentation on population centers i remember when i saw the movie coma back in i think it was the early 60s and i i i kind of irritated you know such fantasy such nonsense someone goes into a hospital and they wind up in a ward down in the basement and they're kept on drugs and experimented with disease and they finally escape and never happen in this country maybe in hitler's germany or something and then i find out the mk ultra thing that exactly that was done in over 200 medical schools and mental hospitals what is mk ultra i don't recall that that was the program the ci's program for for under the technical services division to experiment on on population centers with disease and drugs what years was this it started in the 50s and lasted until the 70s when jack anderson began to expose it and then the media caught on to it and the congress investigated and the ci by the way destroyed thousands of files of victims people that had you know experimented upon so they couldn't ever get their files ensued and supposedly it was stopped except it was such a broad program that there was never any one bill that said stop this it was just that the exposure made everybody presume that the thing would be stopped and i i i i you have to be very troubled and very skeptical not one person was punished that one person involved lost a paycheck or was censored or was fired or much less jailed for those you know for the experimentation on american citizens with disease and drugs in the meanwhile i ain't going to share my needle with you anymore boy yeah no that the the needle usage and homosexuality is clearly uh uh that's not a fantasy that's not a myth that's something where where gays should take every precaution and drug users are just inviting self-destruction by using the needles and there's so many questions about this thing that i would advocate caution but i would also you know very much like to get inside fort dietrich's files and see what evidence there might be 
"There they don't want what we know You will never get these on CNBC School system Will never tell us these Because they are part of it Disguised money Hypocritical teacher False assets I know the game of the rich My rich dad taught me You know because you are a banker Banker is a rich player It's different from what they taught you in school in this world How does the school teach you money? The answer is: nothing This is neither an error Not by accident I know, most people also know Ways to keep the middle class working hard Is never to teach them what the rich know So if you read Rich Dad, Poor Dad published in 1997 A book on how rich people teach their children about money The poor and the middle class did nothing Poverty is hurt I mean, I don't like this And I don't like that our academic system is so corrupt We know the banking system is corrupt We know political corruption But academia is equally corrupt I think banking and politics are the same thing But this is where we send the kids We believe they will do the right thing for children however They are not taught so basic Just like when you asked your father when you were a kid Ask your teacher When do you tell or teach us about money? Then they just Say nothing I will never tell you what do you know? Share it What is financial education? It is not Get a job, work hard or save money And invest in a diversified portfolio of investment finance Stocks, funds or ATF The financial industry contains two things: debt and taxes Nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard in 1971 This turned the dollar into debt However, we still tell children to learn and get jobs Work hard, save money and get out of debt Who is telling them to do this? This is simply ridiculous The first line of the book says Saving money will make you rich Actually, it never will, you know We are all taught to be children Why do you save money? Why do you work for it If they can be printed Faster than you work for it Why do you keep it when it is printed? The rich never work for money You don't touch those things This is a very delicate right, isn't it? They won't say I will train you to be a worker bee for the rest of your life But they somehow teach you where to go This is why you came here What else? What do they want to do? What did you do for them in the first few months? What is he trying to get from you? Because he teaches you how to get money Let's try to say if you are ready to succeed in life You need to find the best teacher And a good teacher always comes from inside, not from outside But at school you do nâ€™t know Is your mentor true or false This is the source of hypocritical teachers I said: I want you to teach me money Why should I teach you? But if I teach you, you need to work for me for free Then I said: Why is it free? My dad, my poor dad got angry, he said If I pay you, you will think like an employee Your brain will change If you learn to never work for money You will become rich This is a right, once you give someone a salary Their brains will shut down Then the promise of pensions One job guarantee This is the disguised salary After you stop working Give this man a fish, eat it for a day, and teach him how to fish Can eat for a lifetime Most poor people are confused Assets and liabilities They think their house is an asset and a liability Yes Assets are nouns, like a house Cash is liquid, is a verb So to understand whether it is assets or liabilities Like a noun plus a verb If cash flows out of your pocket It is debt If cash goes into your pocket, money flows It is an asset I own 7000 properties for rent They are all assets and have cash inflows every month Many people have big houses on the hill But cash out Then they are going bankrupt It's like a frame of mind Another thing the poor don't understand is For most people, the most important expense is taxes Yes, we haven't even seen it, isn't it weird? You look around You look at your salary and say they are a bit wrong But you didn't realize The government has put a huge hand in your pocket And you can't do anything to minimize it This is what makes the rich and the poor very different The rich do not work for money, the first cost is taxes You see, there are 3 kinds of income here. Profit, portfolio, passive income So profit is earned income, if I get a job, this is my income If I am a doctor or programmer, that is my income Because i work for it If I buy an apple for $ 10, I sell for $ 20 That's, uh . Portfolio income, capital gains But passive income, that is, cash flow But never taxed That's why these guys are screaming in the United States now Too many taxes and good luck Because most complainers do nâ€™t know There are actually 3 types of income In any case, the rich do not have any jobs They have assets So the average is smaller than the poor guys there You know send kids to school and they won't learn this You see, few people buy me Make $ 1 million but pay zero taxes When my rich dad taught me to play Monopoly That's how it changes, the difference between 4 green houses and a red hotel Or the origin of McDonald's? McDonald's is real estate business They sell hamburgers and then they buy real estate So they don't pay taxes You know this guy Bezos, he has $ 16 billion How much tax did he pay for this $ 16 billion? zero However all this is legal and anyone can do it Most people lack education So you have to learn how to use debt as money You can never say i can't afford it You see, because the bank will give you money So these banks, after the 2008 financial crisis The bank gave me $ 300 million tax free When I asked ordinary people, I said, can you? Why not choose debt? They ca nâ€™t even get a loan Because they score This Fico score, they only have those there Just too bad The school teacher will never tell you these Because they don't know My poor dad never knew this You don't know if something is an asset or a liability Until you can say it in cash flow So the house, is it an asset or a liability? If you are taking money from a bag This is a liability If you put money into your pocket, this is the asset The U.S. government wants us to provide housing Provide work, and ask us to borrow money Because this is how to create money through debt Like a huge tax benefit Everyone can do the same thing If they all have financial education to do it If people understand tax policies, we will become more prosperous But can poverty also be genetically inherited? This is because of a certain way of thinking And an attitude It's very simple when people ask me how can I stop all this? I just, never say, I ca nâ€™t afford it Ask yourself, what should I do? Why i have so much money Because I never said, I can't do it, I just do it, what should I do? Then I just do it! I made a lot of mistakes But this is how I learn, how can I do it? But the poor, like my poor dad Always say i can't afford Do you think I did it with money? I'm a school teacher, I can't do it! I chose to give up My rich dad never used words like this So whenever I meet the poor I use words like I can 't Many times These people will say, I ca nâ€™t afford it, I ca nâ€™t do it I can't go to college The rich are evil now I choose not to participate This is one thing people can change today It's a conversation in their head Stop saying the word can 't So, what should I do? Especially when I ca nâ€™t afford it, how can I afford it? Because it made them start to think of it as an investment For a better future Yes, like when I borrowed $ 300 million I can't do it when I just want to ask When I was rejected many times, I think you know Whenever I show my finances to the bank, they leave Sorry please take a look Do me a favor, why do you reject me he told me This is how the numbers are here So if I fix those numbers Can I see you again? So it's called rejection My wife also rejected me for 6 months It's just about personal will, it's mental ability So i said If they can do it, I can do it too But what should I do? I think this is what you once said Speech becomes a limb Intelligence and experience will increase through your mistakes Up and down Or let you learn something Real estate is real estate But what I learned made me rich, not money He taught me that money is only used to make money You know i think we all Everyone has a trough of life But if they get the information A new life will begin If they do nâ€™t have the information, they will continue to fall I get richer because I don't need any money I can use them to make money But how did I get there, I made so many mistakes People are afraid to make mistakes Everything is afraid of failure Good, good, very good Many people can feel this sound"
but I gotta say something about this guy he is a true renaissance man okay he is a jiu-jitsu virtuoso all right reinventing the martial art basically getting some flack for it from some of the traditionalist he's a coach in the UFC he's doing music and he's also known and this is one of the reasons I gravitate prison-house the conspiracy theorist because I don't want to say I'm a conspiracy theories myself but I do go around it so what the flat earth yeah like a lot of people are like any really but tell us why yes yes it's really simple it's really simple they lied to us about six moon missions the the greatest technological achievement of mankind they liked with six times fake video fake pictures I don't believe anything coming from mainstream information science mainstream media entertainment I think it's all bullshit okay do you have any theories on what happened in Las Vegas because I've seen a lot of conspiracy theories revolving around that that's all looks like a false flag to me looks like a giant cover-up are you because here's one thing and I gravitate towards your openness for these conspiracy theories because I myself am somewhat of a conspiracy theorist but do you do tend to do that with every major event every major event that's covered by like CNN and all the major networks if they're all covering the same thing you got to look at that like a super suspicious detective you're not you should be looking in like hey this one might be real they think they can't be lying about everything you know you got to look at it like this is probably support where did all this down or suspicion stem from was there something in your life or something that you saw that just made you really question media yes well the first time I questioned media has 15 and I was really into like satanic speed metal underground Slayer and my Kreator and Sodom real they were they wrote about Satan in every song okay and both as I'm 15 years old and I know they're not really into it's just I could it's just like a doctor that's it's a director that's into horror movies like did did the guy who write The Exorcist was he really satanic so we all knew it was just a show but then on 20/20 they announced 15 they put on this this this episode where they're accusing fans like Motley Crue and Twisted Sister and Judas Priest of being satanic and I was thinking I'm like I'm thinking they got the wrong man yeah it's not Twisted Sister how come they're not talking about Slayer right so at that point at that point I thought and they have the PMRC these these old ladies going how's your Pierce if your kids are listening to Twisted Sister they're probably satanic so right there I realize wow this is ABC this channel seven's 2020 and day of no clue so at that point that was the beginning right there and also you know finding out that not everybody was Catholic I was brought up and in Santa Ana California where everybody in Santa Anas Catholic and then when you find out when I was 11 and I found out that there's other religions like there's a puzzle I'm like what how do we know that we're right I thought everybody was Catholic that's what I'm like oh my god could you have foreseen that this this part of your personality I mean your your regular and Joel Rogan okay which is opened you up to a whole new audience you're on shows you're on podcast like Adam Jones's podcast which is the chief conspiracy theory progress who did you ever foresee that that would become such a big part of your brand because it's enough to say that you're this jujitsu guy that you know we invented the martial art coach um see you guys the the first band I was in was all cuz I didn't know anything about conspiracy this was in the 80s I was in a band called resistance and it was all about conspiracy but I didn't know there was no internet he was the resistance we didn't I don't know what the hell I was talking about back then I just I just knew that they were lying and I had no proof I'm like I don't believe you know you watch TV I believe though that the earth is flat I believe I don't believe what the mainstream was coming from mainstream cosmology I don't believe it I'm just highly suspicious of it they fake six moon landings you got to ask yourself a question how many times do they have to fake stuff like moon missions before you don't believe anything means six and some people could be some people it could be 50 you know what I mean but there's a documentary you want it you want to the best documentary on it's called the history of Flat Earth it's by Eric Dubay watch that it's on YouTube that'll explain that it's not I'm gonna watch it cuz I'm flattered if the beta's have been going on for a long time they've been trying to suppress it so anything I want you to watch those I want you to watch our channel if you have DIRECTV's the NASA it's called Earth cool if you use from the sacrum from the space station that show the curvature of the earth that's all with a fisheye lens people want to believe they take six more missions but people still want to believe it look you're not gonna make any money if you believe that right he's just he's saying that they faked the moon missions like how am I supposed to know that six moon missions were faked it just seen all the videos on YouTube that show how they faked it I don't believe it so then you're gonna guess what yes but there's no definite proof of either one there's massive proof no but you can't you eight but now I see it I would love to see it's not I think that it's not definitely either way but I will say this I want you to keep looking into anything you're like my favorite guests keep coming back I want to see what the next you go from one conspiracy theory to another so in a few months you'll probably be obsessed with something else bring them back we'll talk about it you'll put someone else the flat earth one will talk about it and congratulations you're successful Tony Ferguson you're not a coach of a UFC champ and you deserve to be the coach man thanks a lot oh by the way we talked about EDI Eddie Bravo Invitational this weekend right not this Sunday but next up because there's six weeks on this October 22nd October 22nd we're at the Orpheum in downtown LA you can watch our UFC fight pass order on pay-per-view inch by inch TV 
all right what's up y'all it's me it's kanye and it's michael um okay we're gonna go trim that all right y'all i'm back here with me it's me and michael we're gonna be doing what's easy and prevail here we're gonna be doing a podcast on we're gonna be doing some conspiracy theories all right first thing we're gonna start off with is i'm going straight to it fake movement okay so there's a theory that there's a fake moon and they never land on the moon they just did it in some type of studio or whatever like it wasn't real at all like let me show you let me show you that landing on the moon you see how this flag is waving yeah okay now if you're a space there ain't no air so how's the flag even waving in the first place you feel me see that was a red flag and there was a boot okay there's another boot mark and there's grass in the ground or whatever and it was a different footprint from the one that the suits they was wearing and just everything seemed very staged you feel me but how do you feel about that though oh she was Laughter i think it's fake because like if they're going into space and you go to space and you die how the hell do you know what to bring to space if the person that went to space didn't survive oh yeah okay there was another thing that i thought about too okay maybe because humans are so smart or whatever i mean you look like humans but um how if you have a whole jet or ship or whatever you going to a different moon or going to a different planet or whatever how the __ are you supposed to land like and everything in the pictures they showed us it's like i understand the planet was way smaller i mean yeah but it's like you could see all around it from just one picture of it it just doesn't seem right i don't know because they drop off half the damn they rock it anyways when they go up there yeah i don't know that's could be captain you feel me all right let's move on to the next like four times i'm saying and then it was like so many so many things that was wrong with in the first place didn't even make sense okay okay you know the ancient periods of whatever that we was taught about in school yeah i know what the tier means okay so those each one of those brick pyramids weighed 2.5 tons okay how the __ is humans picking up 2.5 hold on look at this there's two point three million stones on that pyramid there's no way no humans could have did that now what if some aliens from a different planet or whatever came down and built them pyramids all right it's that you know that bug no no no no no no think about it the universe is emptiness always expanding or whatever i want to say no aliens with no good technology just came to this __ and just made those nah i believe i believe that like when a person from like a phil or something or a god from back then that dutch the people were using slaves like no i think that people did make that like they were forced to though they didn't do it willingly oh yeah because remember okay i also remember we learned mr barcena class that they was doing it was like there was like slaves of benefits Laughter look look at teen titans go okay this is just something i randomly saw in teen titans you know how they be programming __ they just be mixing the trouble eyes so if teen titans they was talking about they had some like aliens and they showed the pyramids and all that they just be mixing the truth for lies that's why the simpsons they always be predictive programming and they put that __ in teen titans when they had the pyramids okay i'm gonna go to it three minutes shut up okay i don't try to fight this __ though okay it's not playing like oh play some now bro you see this right oh this __ is an alien you know star you watched teen titans before yeah i watched it before okay the sheer alien they just showed her as an alien they even gave her more characteristics they show her coming down __ putting pyramids on think herself because the humans couldn't do that imagine 10 people getting around a car trying to pick it up and moving it moving it you can't do that __ it's not humanly possible to pick up 2.5 tons but the go to a picture of the pyramid you're like a picture of it i can't spell it all i spent the right the first time god damn it bro look at how tall that __ is if it was even if that was okay what the hell they was even going up here imagine them trying to go up there and place pyramids up there yeah they had to be people following that from that __ i mean you could say and they just forced them to do it anyway but let me look at one brick off the pyramid that's what i was trying to see but it doesn't look like it breaks it looks like a whole bunch of those rocks put together yeah what a couple people definitely can definitely do that 2.5 them things look a little as hell too like if they tried to move that __ i don't know it looks like maybe five people if i okay maybe eight people can hurt her around that and then back then i'm pretty sure there was no strong ass __ like you know like me they could actually put in work like that so imagine eight people being hey now i'm that goat though you feel me but i can't imagine there being eight people being able to pick that up in that volume or whatever picking up 2.5 tons i can't even see nobody even i can i can't even see some of them people their ass used to be skinny as hell because their ass wasn't even eaten right i can't imagine that oh no i can't imagine i can't imagine some damn aliens coming down this whole look i can't imagine they asked damn lifted 200 pounds if they can't deal with 200 pounds separately i can't see how they lifted 2.5 tons together there's no way one way one brick wave two points yeah one brick didn't weigh that a brick probably weighed like maybe 200 maybe 500 something around there ain't no way but okay and it wasn't they didn't just have one people like look how many people look how many slaves they had during that time like not even slaves but like type __ you know what i mean all right okay two points okay there's they why would they be like okay we already know bro two point you can't see that playing 2.5 tons okay look limestone that oh what if they were just oh no bro i just i don't know i can't see i can't see someone like an alien __ coming down this damn why would they want to come here what the hell i don't know hey different different possibilities you never know i guess hey __ what i think what if they're here what if we air area 51. going to area 51 is actually you leaving this __ i'm gonna do a backflip into that oh me that's probably why they try to kill people that go next to that __ hey hey hold on in all seriousness how do you get a job working for area 51 probably got to be with the government yeah but this is like stem in the family like what if all they family just __ die now you probably have to be with the you probably got to be a signed contract or some type of dedication to the government so you got to do what they say you can do that just to see well you probably have to like swear on oath and type __ you know all types of security measures oh no i put that __ on put that __ on you now i'm joking if you wanna die bro but 2.3 billion bricks okay let's let's look how long it took them hold on what was that noise Laughter 20 years do you think they lift him look up how many people were used to build the pyramid i 20 to 30 000 people i okay hello 100k okay 100k workers by the monitoring you actually figured more than 20 30 000. okay let me go on my phone and do some math we gonna eyeball it for you okay let's do 100k plus 30k divided by two let's say there's 65 000 people working there people let's see how the ass looked no look don't mean nothing i know they don't mean nothing but that was not gonna be skinny as hell lifting though putting in your work but they worked like they did that for a living like they worked i'm not explaining but they wasn't weak like they they couldn't have been weak i'm not saying like they was totally weak but if y'all asked a slave or whatever yo ass not getting fed that much that ass probably ain't feeding you good yo ass got no breaks y'all got no time to recuperate only think they were slaves i forgot the word an indentured servant i'm pretty sure he doesn't remember that i just remember him saying they were slaves with benefits and that's yours like that 65 000 people okay let's say i'm trying to see one stone boom you see how big them stones is my __ them __ look fancy __ okay okay some of them some sources said when i looked there down they said 50 tons or whatever we just don't say they weighed two tons as much as a __ car if you have to place 2.3 million of those and you have to go up accelerate up like you walking up with them bricks stacking them down i mean you know what i think what's up i think that all right you know how it's sand around like it was in the desert see like in that picture down there oh this car i forgot it was touch street touch screen all right no it's sand all around right i don't feel like those bricks were or the whatever whatever those are that they i don't think that's how big they were i think they were smaller and then from the sand clustering on top of the pyramids that made it look and made it like it made it look yeah and it made it heavier so nowadays when we test and see how heavy they were it's like tons because the sand piled up onto the rocks and made the rocks bigger you get what i'm saying yeah i i get what you put down but i feel like they were smaller and they stacked them up in a pyramid shape and then the sand just kept on piling on top so the pyramid got bigger and then like you know yeah i know okay but it's like okay how much you want to say they weigh okay if they were two okay if they weighed 200 it wouldn't took 20 years let's keep it above but there's like four of them like four of them look look at the pyramid down there one two three four five six like six pyramids no below yeah right there oh yeah you know how hot it had to be out there but it has to be out there slaving after picking up the pyramid bro i don't know all i know is if if it was some humans that did that oh there's some goats jesus two points someone would say at 50 but i'm not even sure i didn't read that always so i'm gonna say it was 50 because i don't even feel like going back to read that __ 2.5 bro 2 million 300 like talk 2.3 million stones __ bricks __ that's light work with my pinkies i'm awesome i mean if your ass ain't doing that next another video probably like a couple seconds after this one but all right y'all it's been one drop of like follow me on ig klg underscore easy you feel me if you're __ with me 
have you seen the moon landing video conspiracy the video yeah okay do you think there's no there's no stars do you think we act that we actually went to the moon when we say we did obviously i think we've been to the moon but when we first said we did do you think that we went no i think that the what 1960 2000 it could have been 1904 i don't know now whenever the the video was uh being live streamed because i'm sitting there like all right so you're telling me that back then their computers that they sent you know a a ship sent people to the moon with were equivalent to a modern day calculator that so so you're if you're telling me that how the __ did they live stream them stepping on the __ moon is that is all right how the how would they even do that i agree with your point i don't agree with your argument because the computers that like universities may have had were equivalent to a modern day calculator but nasa had the best computers of 1960. of not well you know look at look up what it was because i'm almost positive i'm pretty sure it was like 68. when was the movie shaking the table brian shut up __ yeah you saw him stop 1969 1960 so it's almost 1970. so i think by that point it's not too far-fetched so that we could live stream but i have enough trouble live streaming to twitch from my house let alone from the moon so you know maybe you're onto something well i know that some channels were uh i don't know if all of them were because obviously i wasn't alive in 1969 but i know that um at some point they were uh what they were showing on the the cable networks were vhs tapes that were already recorded they would take them put them in the machine and then they'd be streamed to the to the tv so what was i'm almost positive that uh we gotta look up one more thing was the moon landing live streamed yeah because i'm pretty sure that it was because i remember hearing a story about um uh yeah okay so it was broadcast live around the world on july 21st 1969. however um dude that doesn't make sense because they i just looked it up and it said july 16 1969 was the moon landing and they said it was live stream on the 21st so were they already there for a couple days and then they did it i don't think so like you go to the moon you're like hey yeah i want to go outside now not almost a week from now i mean they brought back a bunch of moon rocks one other thing like tons and tons of moon rocks well my thing is all right so have you heard haven't heard first have you heard the video of uh or the the audio of what was it uh new armstrong paris was it neil degrasse tyson yeah did you hear the la the audio of the guilt yeah yeah whatever okay mike tyson talking on but uh he was like i i don't know what this is there it's in the background there is lights floating around us right now have you heard that i don't know if i watched that part of it it's kind of creepy __ creepy and there was video too because uh it was like playing in the background of him like out the little porthole of the yeah the craft and and it was showing like these lights flying around now a lot of it can be staged now my question is before we move further into this i want you did russia ever go to the moon do you know the answer to that question i do not know the answer to that question i don't either did any has anybody else went to the moon are they allowed to go to the moon since we put a flag there is that kind of no we we own it it's sort of like alaska but it's practically puerto rico um it says soviet union united states japan the european space agency china india luxembourg and israel have went to the moon have stepped foot on the moon or have sent like satellites well no actually it doesn't even say that they've been to the moon it just says missions to the moon have been conducted by the following nations and okay because here's my point here's where i was going because we were neck and neck with the soviet union right like they they have they said that they were close to going to the moon and then we we hadn't publicly declared that we were close yet right and then all of a sudden here's footage of us up on the moon like does that not seem a little fishy like you know we're america we boast about what we do and then all of a sudden bam we're on the moon there's no point to come here ain't nothing here you do have a point there however um we don't know whether or not we've actually been to the moon well no i feel like for sure we have been to the moon but but now i guess i have the first time yeah the first time is what i'm talking about but because we 100 have been to the moon we have um a laboratory completely focused on studying the moon rocks that we got back and it's like the the place that they're kept during these little mobile carts that have uh like uh the atmosphere like atmospheric pressure that yeah like atmosphere from the uh the moon yeah so that none of the bacteria none of that stuff um dies or you know rock implodes from not having the right pressure or anything but here's my thing all right why won't we go back to the moon what's the point because time has passed that we don't know if it has changed rocks that we got from there 30 years ago may not be the same as the rocks that are there now we're more focused on going to mars right now i thought nasa wasn't uh working on shooting any more rockets up well i think they're because spacex trump assembled this the space team right what is it it's called the space team what does it what did he call it space force space force yes space force and that's within nasa right but then isn't elon musk doing the same thing with spacex well i know that spacex has i remember reading an article that said that they have successfully docked with the international space station so for like a uh not it's not called i guess you'd just say refueling mission um just like to see if they could do it pretty much right yeah they just brought i guess rations to them or whatever but uh why why do we even have people up there like what the __ are they doing do we i don't know have they really said um there's a movie i don't remember what it was called but basically they went to the moon first first uh apollo 13. i think that's what it was there's a series called like the first or something on netflix no that it was a movie and it's called like apollo 13 and it's like an imagining of why won't why we won't go back to the moon and the thing is there's like creatures or creatures or something on the moon that like takes out this whole crew or whatever and it basically explains why we're not going back to the moon was the earth actually round yeah do you not think the earth is round it's not a perfect spear but it's round jeweler well in the bible um i know you're a bible thumper so you're probably getting a little thumper um in the bible it says that the earth has been put on a pedestal or uh raised on a pedestal or something like that so that would protect that would technically mean like you think you can't it's on a pedestal do you no it's figurative speech brian you're the bible thumper here i'm just repeating what i heard i don't think they literally mean that the earth is sitting on on a big marble pedestal floating in the earth floating underneath the earth because that were true literally wouldn't we uh see the pedestal well that that would mean that the earth is round uh yeah i'm saying that do you think the earth was flat i'm just i'm just repeating what i've heard theirs is not flat i mean that's just stupid obviously the earth is round why is the earth round why do you say the earth is round so if there if there's an argument that if people argue the earth is flat right why don't they argue that the moon is flat or that mars is flat because they're even real i thought they were just holograms well you can see all right now you're just now you're just trying to piss me off is that what you're doing i'm just trying i'm just making the argument man why you're not why do you think why do you think the earth is round because you were told that the earth is round has anybody told you that the bible's real or did you come to that well you let me talk if you look up in the sky and you see the moon is the moon round yeah it's round right you can see the moon okay so when we send a dude up there into the space where they can see the earth and it's round how do you think it's flat did we go to the moon because how are you supposed to land on a hologram i still don't i i don't understand your point i'm not laughing here dude i'm being serious all right let's just let's let's move on to another topic i know you can't you can't tell me why you think the earth is round i mean like did somebody tell you that well considering i'm not a scientist we're not scientists who've done the research we kind of have to believe other research right um well scientists go out to to prove other people wrong you're right that's that's the whole point of research or to prove something right either to prove somebody wrong or to prove somebody right so why do you think the earth is around because you were told why do you believe this as you were told because common sense says that earth is round why do you think there's riots going on right now please stop i i have another conspiracy theory to ask you about okay yeah i mean i think we kind of took them like all right first of all let's just run through the a couple questions to finish off the moon theory then i have another one all right all right do you think that we went to the moon the first time um there was no stars just answer me yeah yeah right so now do you think i don't think that it could be live streamed and i don't think that there i i didn't see any stars but you would 100 be able to see both stars the flag was waving but there is no wind on the moon there that was one of the things i'm not going to argue that just because i mean i don't know moon rocks are really gritty right and they were talking about them always blowing around on the moon and you have to watch getting them in like little creases in your in your space suit because they grind together and they're they're really porous so but but we agree on the big point of this which is that we probably didn't go to the moon the first time we definitely have been to the moon at some point and i think we deserve to know why we won't go back is that fair to say well it was a lot of money to get there to begin with and it it so if you were wondering why we're not going back it was a lot of money to get there and we spent that money to begin with just because we wanted to wave our hog around because we wanted to beat the russians yeah we we're like you drunk __ can't do this and then we're like all right you 
ever since the corona virus pandemic caused travel restrictions lockdowns and economic downturns around the world it was being expected that this pandemic will give way to a new world order China is being accused of causing the pandemic by mishandling the covert 19 outbreak and covering up its severity the Chinese regime did so with the help of its authoritarian regime where the voices of doctors and citizen journalists were muzzled it did so with its deep influence in the w-h-o which helped Bluff the world and now it has resorted to acts of aggression in the time of the pandemic be here in Hong Kong the South China Sea or the border with India now China is facing serious backlash from every direction and there is an increasing sentiments to hold the CCP regime accountable Beijing fears a shake-up in the global equations and its fears have come true as Donald Trump has proposed to expand the g7 by inviting Russia India South Korea and Australia to join the group of most advanced economies this is a clear sign of the new world order which is here as the expanded g7 consisting of g7 countries and India South Korea and Australia the three countries have reportedly accepted Trump's invitation the extended group is likely to meet in September to discuss China's future this comes days after Trump called for the expansion of the quote-unquote very outdated group and said that the meet would now be held in September November India Russia South Korea and Australia should also be invited the president has said that countries like India Australia South Korea and Russia should also get representation in the grouping and it should be called the g10 or g11 Trump said I'm postponing it because I don't feel that as a g7 it probably represents what is going on in the world only Russia seems unlikely to join the expanded g7 because the suggestion of bringing Russia into the extended fall hasn't gone down well within group of world's most advanced economies the UK and Canada have opposed Trump's invites to Russia Russia was excluded from this group earlier called the g8 and response to his invasion of Crimea moreover Beijing and Moscow have been showing a sense of camaraderie admits the ongoing pandemic and it doesn't sound reasonable for Putin to join a group that is clearly aimed against China however in the case of a triangular world order where the US Russia and China from the three different polls anything is possible above this earlier it was reported that the UK was planning to propose a d-10 alliance of 10 democracies including India to counter Chinese CCP backed 5g giant Huawei the prospect of an expanded g7 coming together has riled up China and Beijing has been castigating countries on this latest development Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Chao Li John has said China believes all international organizations and conferences should be conducive to mutual trust between countries - holding multilateralism promoting world peace and development he added that we believe this is a role of the overwhelming majority of the countries in the world any attempts to seek small circle against China is doomed to fail and is unpopular clearly the expansion of the g7 with an eye on Beijing hasn't gone down well with China China knows that this group of high-income countries can hurt it like never before these countries can easily use their economic prowess to keep China out of the supply chains and harass its exports based economy moreover within the g10 or the expanded g7 smaller groupings like the quad consisting of India Japan Australia and the United States could come together to further bolster their Indo Pacific strategy of isolating China and strategically crucial maritime region all countries in expanded g7 except India are high-income developed economies but that doesn't in I mean that new delhi's roar will get undermined in fact the whole strategy to reduce dependence on China and to counter its expansionism is centered around India Trump has included India within the expenditures seven keeping in mind that the country would play a big role in replacing China as a premier investment destination and a manufacturing hub for the company is based in the developed world and there may be a developing economy but it is at the center of this expanded intergovernmental economic organizations strategy to approach China's hegemony and welcome a new post coronavirus world order in which China's row will get watered down drastically you
yo what's going on guys ethan rad and i'm back with another video today we're going to be talking about the dark side of hollywood and basically what that entails for the people of hollywood and the people that rise to the huge amounts of fame so i want to talk a little bit about how fame leads to destructive actions so we've seen a lot of hollywood movie stars and people of high power who just seem to be going crazy at the moment kind of like they totally lost themselves and there's couple ideas that you sell your soul when you go big in hollywood and how basically fame leads to actions you don't really control you're getting guided every single move and you're being told what to do constantly and it's the same deal with children and children are more vulnerable in hollywood we've seen dan schneider who apparently has taken advantage of the cast of icarly sam and cat victorious he's said to have done wicked nasty things to the cast and basically controlled their actions and took advantage of them because they had very perspective roles that a lot of people wanted and he had control it's a big competition in hollywood and i think that truly makes the celebrities lose their minds slowly and slowly but it's like what can you do because in hollywood with that vast amount of competition people have to fight and people have to take the sacrifice to sell their soul and to do what they're told to gain these roles and these roles give them a lot of money and it's basically abusing powers for desires and that's what the main main higher up people in hollywood are doing and that's not the actors or the actresses it's the controllers the directors the people who are in control of the movies the tv shows and a lot of parents i've heard are forcing their children into doing this various stuff and they'll basically sell their child to hollywood to make a lot of money and they'll even sell themselves to hollywood for their child's benefit to make money and to be the next big thing which includes abuse mentally and i'm not sure about physically but truthfully we don't know and dan schneider was also talked about doing weird things and being really touchy and huggy and it's just disturbing for these young kids who are ultimately just trying to pursue their dreams but they're dealing with a lot of other you know stuff off in the distance that is kind of probably really messing them up mentally and i want to talk quickly about britney spears because she obviously is a musician so that's more the music industry and i'm also going to make a video about the music industry so look out for that in the next couple days because the music industry is honestly even worse but she's been talking about the third eye being open and how she's just really focusing on manifestation and um just mind control and it's super weird to see from her because she's obviously one of the few people who have kind of spoke out about hollywood and how she you know had the incident where she chopped off her hair and i think it really really messed her up to the point where now she's just trying to better herself and better her soul maybe she's trying to regain her soul somehow i know that sounds crazy but it really really doesn't make sense why else would she you know be so confident in this third eye scenario and along with julia roberts she was seen posting on instagram a third eye on her hand and she said world leaders we are watching you and she was also wearing an aduro mask and one of them and i'm not quite sure what she's pointing at but that's just another sign that there's some kind of world leader influence in hollywood along with the music industry and a lot of other places a lot of high up competitive jobs and professions so it it comes down to what is going on in hollywood and what can we do as a fan base to really help these people truthfully um we don't have much say um a lot of these people are fighting for these jobs fighting for these roles and it's making people lose their minds look at like people like shia labeouf um he had a more of a rough upbringing and now he is seriously devoting his life to movie roles he's getting the tattoos for the movie he's getting tattoos in the script for the movie but he's literally tattooing them permanently he's not using paint and he's going to the absolute stream of smoking cigarettes for the role i think hollywood just truthfully is changing them as people and it's corrupting their minds and it's making children vulnerable and unhappy ultimately as they get into their teens and they've realized what they've been through and how they haven't had a normal upbringing but yeah guys um i know that was kind of just a rant i want to hear you guys opinions in the comments because truthfully there's a lot more than this and it goes on and on we saw chrissy teigen make these weird tweets the other day where she was talking about children and just really disturbing stuff and we got to think like what is going on there why is hollywood obsessing over children and why are people so desperate to make these roles for people that are going to treat them negatively and just be mean to them so yeah guys comment down below explain your boy ethan rad music industry video coming out next i have some serious evidence that and it's honestly way more creepy than i think the hollywood is but i think they're both a little bit correlated but yeah you guys spend your boy with the rad i'll see you guys in the next one peace 
there are forces out there that mankind cannot comprehend the earth is warming up radiation is building sickness is running rampant all over the earth but why see if something is just indigenous to earth maybe mankind can change it but what we're what we're having is not indigenous to earth it is not just for earth entire solar system is beginning to do a wicked shimmy and solar activity is a telltale sign of the exotic energy that's coming into the solar system what it emits the solar system is responding to just like your skin responds to infrared light so does the solar system respond to these exonic particles coming in because the source is coming close the source of these waves is coming close now close does not mean right there where you can see it i can assure you that prior to you seeing anything this world is gonna rumble like you never saw before welcome to the wtf files the ultimate aim of all science to penetrate the unknown the greatest mystery is right here right under our feet these are the stories that will make you say wtf for the risk of sounding like a person who truly did jump out of the bushes yelling it's coming it's coming very serious conversation we're going to talk about today it's not my job to cause anybody to believe but out of my heart i do wish to give you warning a little preparatory time that you be prepared not taken by what you mean what you may see coming it's as simple as that i'm to put some things into perspective it will either confirm the truth within you or not but in either case we're going to see drastic changes both in the earth and mankind we will see them your entire paradigm what you know is reality has been secured for a long time everything has stayed stationary in the skies we keep track of seasons and everything else by atomic time things of that nature of constants and science and formulas we've been spoiled really we've had a time of rest for a long time the only problems we've absolutely had were problems of war but the great calamities were held back far and few in between so then the knowledge that existed so long ago will be thrust in the faces of many in the days to come everybody has to be prepared for this according to the truth that you can take in today we're going to discuss preparations for the second wave what the second wave is things that have been happening on the earth indicating massive changes that are taking place i'm not here to connect the dots with anybody else's research but i'm only here to tell you exactly what i know of myself it does go over the darkness a deep darkness that's coming back upon the face of the earth i tell you this you guys for me with the book of revelation another text you know that's something will come up on the face of the earth from below and something will come up on the earth from above what comes from below is already here mingling among men but you don't know how many don't know the explanation of their own dreams many don't know the importance of the magnetosphere many of us have been spoiled because everything has been somewhat stable ladies and gentlemen that stability is about to be challenged in one of the worst ways it can and as these things begin to change and alter the earth so will the minds of mankind become desperate in war will naturally ensue i'm going to explain to you what the darkness is as best i can what i'm familiar with and it takes a toll on everybody who comes in contact with it in fact a person who's irresponsible should never seek out darkness it will truly consume your soul i'll tell you this exotic elements that are coming into the solar system so will that darkness grow darkness will again be upon the face of the earth and what was ancient will rise up again folks you live in a very different time most of what i'm going to say to a lot of people you won't believe but then again no one believes until something happens and then when something happens they seek out the source of those who knew by that time the sources have all their they're all but gone unless you're stuck in a place with no instruction with things you cannot possibly believe just like the undoing of the earth there are signs all around you interiors of the earth everything is waking up the earth right now is about to turn one degree and what indication do you have of that does anybody have an indication of that and it's not going to take a long time for the earth to shift one degree one degree in a tilt is huge one degree one degree is going to continue to change the weather in an abrupt way the water will move melting will start and this is what they always knew about it is under the cover of global warming i tell you this the changes of the earth have nothing to do with humanity and everything to do with truth and is covered over with a lie global warming a key word used for the elite to grab their attention and foretell meetings and everything else do you know what happened in 2004 that's when all the knowledge was solidified the knowledge of global warming actually began in the 1900s that's when the observations took place in 2004 everything was solidified preparations were made in the 1930s and 40s so they could survive yes they have underground basis who doubts that and this won't be a talk about the underground basis but i'm telling you they do exist they do exist i mean everybody should know the common underground bases cfr for greenbriar built in 1958 1962 that was build time it was to allow people to operate and sustain them for 60 days nora and shine mountain 1961 1965 build time that's the space control center communications with national military command iron mountain that's where the elite are protected we can go on china lake mount weather denver australia israel they have underground bases there too these things were built four to five year build time back then what do you think it is now how fast do you think these structures are now and i tell you they're preparing for something you know it is global warming which began 2004 do you not know in 2004 global warming was actually placed on netgeo's website national geographic and it was also on business week what's it doing in business week and they give you the cover that somebody was trying to make money off of it that was to throw you off the path let me tell you how they were can i just tell you how they work because global warming has to do with the exotic things that are coming into the solar system they are intertwined one in the same let me tell you how they work though because you not having certain knowledges you're kept in the dark about many things you can only believe what you see and so you buy the paradigm of which they place before you when they get somebody that grows up in their educational systems they cause them to believe and align thus they go out with a sincere heart begin to fight for that lie global warming you see how that works they actually do believe in global warming those spokespersons because they sincerely believe you can always detect the sincerity that's what keeps it plausible in your mind it's important you understand this process that's how they work how they always have worked is everybody clear on that process like with the government they raise a person telling them lies about the government education they pat them on the back and say job well done and then they place them in a position of power that person wholeheartedly does their job believing in what they're doing they do that so that because you can always sense sincerity i'm telling you that people have been raised into a line you have detected their sincerity which causes you to believe in their cause then it spreads like a virus this is what has happened to the world and it's time that you look beyond it i know there's still some folks back in washington who refuse to admit that climate change is real and on a day like today it's hard to get too worried about it they're folks who will equivocate they'll say you know i'm not a scientist well i'm not either but the best scientists in the world know that climate change is happening our analysts in the intelligence community know climate change is happening our military leaders generals and admirals active duty and retired know it's happening our homeland security professionals know it is happening and our coast guard knows it's happening the science is indisputable we become a slave to a paradigm that's an illusion all of what you see is not real though it has real effects upon your life you are simply maneuvered by a control system that you need to break free of i'm trying to help you before it comes crumbling down and then your heart starts pumping very fast because in your mind you will think that your world came to an end men's hearts will fail them for fear for looking after those things that are coming up on the world that's not from one thing that's from multiple things 2004 global warming at the front pages they already admitted back in 2004 and swept all that under the carpet they didn't know the dynamics of climate change and thus princeton university was charged with the task of coming up with something and coming up with something quick now when you talk about global warming people get this question in their heads they'll say i don't believe in global warming yet it's getting warmer every single year so what they did was they threw out a word and people began to chase and support the word with what's happening in the world the conditions of global warming are absolutely 100 percent real the earth is warming up radiation is building sickness is running rampant all over the earth but why is either forces out there that mankind cannot comprehend 2004 everything started why did it start in two thousand four because that was the impact of a magnetar that's why that was the impact of a magnet magnetar that's when the top of our atmosphere was ripped off by a wave sent by magnetar that's why a piece of our atmosphere was ripped off and you didn't even know it in 2004 nobody talked about that did they anybody discuss that no they didn't oh they had all the instrumentation in the world monitoring it they were scared to death they didn't know what would happen they didn't know but i'm telling you they were deathly afraid because they saw it coming they see a lot of things coming they're not going to tell you for what good would that do you would only get in the way telling you that in 2004 everything changed and that's why in 2005 they the united nations at the climate change conference we know that climate change is the single most important environmental issue facing the world today the scientific evidence on climate change from the integral governmental panel on climate change that met in montreal in september and from many others is more compelling than ever we know that the longer we wait the larger will be the challenge and the damage from climate change the broad-based consensus is that more action is required now how convenient 2004 global warming that that discussion really takes off and in 2005 they had the climate change conference how convenient ever since 2005 what have you noticed a change in weather phenomena a change in earthquake activity a change with the other objects in space that's why we send probes all over the place for proof of something yes but to also monitor we've got satellites and craft orbiting just about everything we can because they serve as an early warning system of what will happen to earth see if something is just indigenous to earth maybe mankind can change it but what we're what we're having is not indigenous to earth it is not just for earth entire solar system is beginning to do a wicked shimmy and solar activity is a telltale sign of the exotic energy that's coming into the solar system the sun acts as a shield to the entire solar system the sun does just as your skin acts as a shield to protect your insides and to keep things away from the precious internal portions of your body right so does the sun create a barrier to keep highly charged particles at bay and every so often it's pierced the skin the skin we could say that envelops our solar system is weakening and things are coming through there's nothing mankind can do about it and it's coming that was december 27th earth was impacted by that blast 2004 december 27th and when you know we have another one coming in december how strange why because there's a phenomenon space called pulses right pulses pulses happen at intervals normally when something blows like a magnet or something like that sends out multiple shock waves it's like a i don't know triple quadruple explosions right well they're headed towards earth from more than one source there's nothing anybody can do about it which is why everybody's watching for the shock wave in october we could have some severe atmospheric problems in october as a shockwave finally passes through earth it is believed right now that shockwave could affect at least one third of our atmosphere as far as the other effects nobody knows we do know that that this thing is just charged with energy because it's coming from a source of almost pure energy 2004 that magnetar just barely skipped us in fact it didn't even touch us but it ripped off a portion of the atmosphere i i tell you this when it passed it was millions of miles away but it still sucked off part of our atmosphere that's a problem i believe the distance of that pulse of magnetar was about the distance from earth to mercury that's the distance you're talking about right i'm sorry twice the distance between earth and mercury it was twice the dis and it still popped off a piece of our atmosphere still even with that distance so can you begin to see what the earth must undergo what it's about to undergo it's not a play thing there were also psychological effects that took place in 2004 that have been evolving since then listen a great war is also on the horizon now they're going to utilize the breakdown and the fracturing of this planet and war will ensue they're going to utilize this heavenly event this event of a breakdown they they're going to use that to their advantage for war the inhabitants of the earth will surely be few i would go so far as to say 50 of humanity in the first phase of this war is going to be dead everybody with me so far just like cern right there is public there's a public uh side of cern and then there's the true side of cern i can assure you nobody's trying to collide little bitty particles and to find out what i can assure you that's not the mission where they're going to cure cancer with it no it all leads back to something else now there is the public side of science of which people are passionate about that's the part they know but listen to me close in every single experiment somebody collects the data who collects the data not everybody's aware of so what they're doing is having people who believe in the experiment giving them a a portion of a job they go out and accomplish that job and spend their lifetime doing it so somebody else can collect the data and they're doing something else with the results but the people on top they only know the experiment they're saying yes we're doing our best in the experiment it works and that's how they get back online and say well you don't know what you're talking about certainly has nothing to do with this that any other that's what the experts will say cern has nothing to do with this that the other why because they're passionate about that compartmentalized task that they have so they accomplish what they're given to accomplish but as a whole they don't know what it's producing there's a portion of science that's a mystery to those folks they're not educated in full sciences why in the world would anybody ever do that if you had knowledge of all things there's no way you could teach others knowledge of all things they wouldn't have a precept for it so those who know the exotic sciences in the rest of the sciences are the ones who are collecting the information doing something with it the particles are already coming through already coming through right it's kind of like a fireplace you light up a fireplace right you get near the fire and you start feeling the heat the fire didn't pass through you you didn't pass through the fire but you feel the heat what is that infrared light or your feeling is light you know that that's what you feel light that's all you're feeling what is that infrared light of radiation is it going to kill you well if you're over exposed to it's going to burn you up but your flesh reacts to the radiation it raises your body temperature by exciting molecules in your flesh though therefore you feel heat heat is movement movement is heat okay you got that heat is movement movement is heat so when you get near something that's infrared the molecules internally begin to move around a lot more and then you feel heat the heat of your body in the same fashion this wave is coming through what it emits the solar system is responding to just like your skin responds to infrared light so does the solar system respond to these exonic particles coming in because the source is coming close the source of these waves is coming close now close does not mean right there where you can see it i can assure you that but prior to you seeing anything this world is going to rumble like you never saw before you telling me the second wave is not going to impact humanity i'm telling you it is in october we're going to find out some details good or bad we'll put them out there you're going to hear many things but it's always good to have your ears open to the holy spirit and the truth that is within you that when it is time to do something you move and when it is not time to do something you stay still because it could be life or death to you that means i don't have the final word on what you must do the lord does not one man on earth has a final word for what you must do the lord knows what you must do and because he said he will never leave you nor forsake you he will instruct you okay so as i go through these things i can only advise but you must have your ear open to the lord because if you don't you're going to follow the advice of man and by that man's word you may die these are the wtf files subscribe today and be sure to like us on

" what if American warfighters could stop a rocket-propelled grenade spot the enemy with binoculars in the sky March all day with superhuman strength swim twice as fast with half the effort sound impossible one shadowy US agency is making all this and more DARPA the agency that's America's secret weapon US forces it's a dangerous world out there but the American warfighter has someone watching his back even though he may never have heard the name drive past this complex on a street near Washington DC and it looks like any other office building there's no logo on the outside no hint to who works here DARPA the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency it's the R&D arm of the Defense Department DARPA enables the game-changing military breakthroughs that others dismiss as impossible if I have an idea for a new tank DARP is not going to be interested in that they're gonna say go to a company that makes tanks but if I have an idea for a hover tank or an invisible tank and I can show a reasonable scientific plan to get to that end goal DARPA is the one who's gonna fund that DARPA has granted National Geographic filmmakers unprecedented access to closely guarded labs remote proving grounds and underwater test areas at DARPA headquarters we surrender our cell phones at the visitor control center edge of edge then we are escorted to the only room where interviews can be conducted sometimes our questions hit a brick wall you know I don't go down that road the security reason don't want to tell you the secret sauce um yeah can i no talk about that let's not talk about that fun for now from developing ways to spot hidden threats in Iraq to designing hypersonic jets that can fly more than five times the speed of sound DARPA tackles what they called DARPA hard problems a problem it's really difficult you just say that's too hard to do and if you if you answer the question like that then it's a DARPA heart problem the highest risk possible is when you put resources on something and you have no idea whether it's going to happen those are DARPA heart problems the problems that are too hard to solve DARPA hard we kill them the world faces a new kind of terror that has transformed the nature of combat America's war fighters have an urgent need for new weapons and defenses to fight a hidden enemy whose attacks are unexpected and deadly case in point how to defend our troops against rocket-propelled grenades in Iraq RPGs are a leading cause of combat death they are cheap to make fast RPGs can be fired from anywhere and raced to their targets in seconds a seemingly unstoppable threat DARPA solution a revolutionary technology called Iron Curtain Iron Curtain was developed to protect lives lives of people in armored vehicles lion armored vehicles against threats such as rocket pelegrin aids many RPGs are so powerful they can penetrate a concrete wall or a foot of solid steel it takes an RPG about a tenth of a second to travel 15 yards to its target DARPA steam has to develop something fast and powerful enough to detect track and destroy it in a split second just inches from the vehicle itself but can it be done at a remote site on the Utah Salt Flats scientists prepare to test the iron curtain system on an armored Humvee it's about to be subjected to an attack by simulated RPG fire as the RPG is flying in the first sensor that sees it is the radar this is the radar antenna so they can track the RPG as it comes in the second sensor that sees it is there's all along here there's an optical sensor and as the RPG flies underneath we're able to select at the exact aim point the countermeasure then has an effect on the exact point that you want it to now since we can't have explosive countermeasures on the test that we're doing out here today we use instead a system that we call the diode gun and we set the lights in sequence so that they travel down at the exact same speed that the countermeasure would be going so we can see then with the high-speed camera that's operating at about 30,000 frames per second we can see precisely where the countermeasure would have hit the RPG today's test will require pinpoint radar detection of the incoming threat and an instant trigger of the countermeasure system before the test the equipment must be calibrated they aim the air cannon precisely using a laser okay that's good a little bit to the right that looks good we have an autonomous system that's GPS guided the guide system around the track so that we can conduct our experiments completely unmanned in three two one go all right let's watch the high-speed only by examining the data can technicians tell if Iron Curtain worked in the critical time frame required footage shot by their high-speed camera indicates that the sensors detected the incoming RPG threat the countermeasures would have effectively been deployed in time to stop the RPG in about 1/10 of a second the Utah test of the iron curtain system using simulated RPGs is a success but can Iron Curtain stop deadly live RPG fire in the case of Iron Curtain we have had several occasions where the system didn't work as planned and the RPG did go high order and destroyed all of our apparatus and you just pick up the pieces in this case literally pick up the pieces and you push on in June 2008 the iron curtain system is tested again with live fire we had a lot of confidence in the system although I won't say that my heart wasn't up here we took a shot we detected with the radar the optical system went on told our countermeasure where to shoot we shot it held our breath and sure enough we've done at the RPG when over wiped the RDX that explosive off the vehicle and congratulate ourselves and on that particular Humvee we only had 3/8 inch armor which is as much and we shot five RPGs at it so you can see impact points of five RPGs on that vehicle and we've obviously we doubted them all we still have our vehicle what exactly is the countermeasure dropping to disable the RPG that remains DARPA secret and behind-the-scenes DARPA found a way to give our warfighters a futuristic helping hand on patrol in Iraq America's soldiers can fall prey to sniper fire to shield themselves our war fighters must rely on 30 pounds of body armor for protection with the rest of their gear they must shoulder as much as 125 pounds to give them the extra strength they need DARPA goes to a place where fact meets science fiction scientist Steve Jacobson at raytheon-sarcos and is working to create a new breed of soldier with superhuman powers his creation the exoskeleton combines a man and a machine to offer extraordinary strength if you put 200 pounds of body armor on somebody right now they're gonna walk about 300 feet if you put 200 pounds of body armor on somebody wear an exoskeleton they can walk all day the exoskeleton mirrors the human body a computer network serves as its nervous system hydraulic valves and actuators function as muscles and its skeleton is made of aluminum the challenge of putting a person inside a machine is a daunting one know when you put a machine around person there's all sorts of places where it interferes with an emotion it may have braids your skin when you first put it on and it's not powered up it feels very heavy because you're wearing a 200 pound robot which is a lot of weight already to power up power up as soon as they power it up all that weight goes away and suddenly you feel like Rex Jamison where's what it's probably the most advanced design currently being tested by a human operator the risk is that it's extraordinarily fast and extraordinarily strong so if it decides to do something you know I can't fight it the exoskeleton is designed to amplify the operators movement without blocking it to read his motion enhance it and make him stronger the superhuman stamina of the exoskeleton makes it a priceless military asset it will allow a soldier to lift 100 pounds with no more effort than lifting 10 when I'm lifting heavy things with the exoskeleton it's surprising you look at the object in your brain thinks you can't pick that up you don't feel any stronger than exascale them but then then you reach out and pick it up and there's no effort at all and it continually surprises me it feels like I'm looking a problem how much load are you filling it pulling 200 pounds moving things is one of the large forgotten jobs in the military and the exoskeleton is designed to help an individual soldier move boxes all day long without getting tired 35 pound ammunition can you know a normal man can lift without much problem but after lifting 20 of them they're gonna get really tired and it requires no effort on my part so I could do it forever basically by reducing fatigue the exoskeleton can enhance the combat performance of the warfighter and the exoskeleton is more than strong it's light on its feet the fun part for me about operating excellent are the speakers like a punching bag and the soccer ball it's very quick and very precise and surprising given how much power it has how I can follow you so quickly the exoskeleton is the best robot in the world right now because there's no other robot in the world that you can climb in to move really do work and not get tired one of the joys of the exoskeleton is watching someone's face who sees it for the first time because to them this has been science fiction but all of a sudden science fiction is real they see a machine on a person and they know tomorrow's here the army is adapting the exoskeleton for supply handling to help our troops bear the burdens of war but strength and stamina are not enough a war fighters survival depends on locating the enemy a new DARPA breakthrough answers that need for our troops survival means spotting an enemy sniper on a rooftop before he spots you when Iraq started it was very clear in the urban area and that what people really wanted was surveillance but they didn't want from ten miles away they just wanted to know what was on the next block DARPA solution the wasp it's no bigger than a toy but looks can be deceiving the thing I think that makes wasps so unique is it has all the same features that are found in a full-size airplane it has an altimeter it has a gyro it has GPS it has a magnetometer all of these things that are found in full-size airplanes are found in a package less than 26 inches and weighs at less than a pound each stage or block of the wasp produced by the Aero vironment corporation was supervised by DARPA program manager Leo Christodoulou this is the block 3 production aircraft this aircraft has multiple capability with modular payloads such as this one which is a high-resolution camera but he could also have a night-vision camera or indeed he could have an extra battery to give it increased endurance think of it as airborne binoculars for the infantry it has the capability to accomplish complex missions with high degree of autonomy in cases where it loses communication and has no instructions you will go to a rally point it will go to a specific location in wait for you there the wasp has already proved effective on covert combat missions where it can be used to help detect snipers or terrorist hideouts one of the key design objectives of the wasp was the ability for a single warfighter to quickly efficiently and easily assemble it and fly in in very short order what I have in the backpack here is a micro air vehicle that a single man can operate here's the air vehicle itself this is a night camera and this is the camera we use for flying in the day this is the controller I use to view the video and control the aircraft in Wilson flight and this is the RF unit which sends up the command to the aircraft and then receives video I'm here at a test range in California we're gonna send this armored vehicle somewhere out on the range way out there and I'm gonna find it with this the target vehicle doesn't stop until it's far beyond his line-of-sight lost in the distance okay I've done the pre-flight system checks are good and we're gonna launch the vehicle and go find that guy powered by an electric motor the wasp block three can travel at a speed of up to 40 miles per hour it's capable of flying for forty-five minutes to a distance as far as three miles away from its operator so I'm looking down the road here yeah we're just seeing where he might have gone or look at the side left right and I'll just keep looking around I'm inside view camera here and I'm just looking to see if we can find him there is there's the vehicle we were able to find the vehicle even more surprising than how well the wasp flies is the way it lands when the wasp lands it's designed to break apart in order to absorb air and energy very much like a NASCAR is designed to break apart when they crash that's the way we design our UAVs such that when they break apart the energy of the door the piece parts may fall apart but then you can pick them up and you can put the airplane right back together again and it's ready to fly Applause not only was it darker hard technologically but he was DARPA fast in terms of getting it into the hands of the operators we needed to turn this aircraft into a robust tough little bird that could take everything that they were fighting my family with the wasp DARPA helps put the element of surprise on our side and surprise has always been part of DARPA DNA since a day that shook the world DARPA was founded when one of our enemies took us by surprise 50 years ago we had Sputnik launched by the mother Russians which greatly surprised this country we never believed that they were going to get to space first tarp is primary mission from the very beginning this would be an agency whose job is to prevent technological surprise to the United States over the years we have found that the best way to prevent technological surprise is to create it so we have gone out and created surprise and in order to prevent it from happening to us DARPA gave America the high-tech edge with breakthroughs like the Saturn moon rocket that began as a DARPA program and stealth technology the reason you have a GPS receiver the reason you have cellphones so small because DARPA created the technology many years ago many other innovations that DARPA helped to pioneer from the computer mouse to the Internet have transformed our lives has been involved from the very beginning in enabling technologies if we could have a sticker it would say DARPA inside and and that sticker would go to every high-technology product there probably is DARPA is quest for advanced technology ratcheted up after the deadly attacks of 9/11 suddenly we faced a determined and elusive enemy who posed an unnerving new threat I actually worked in the Pentagon at the time and after 9/11 word came down that it was imperative that we had systems that could get places fast over long distances DARPA envisioned a game-changer that could fly over 4,000 miles per hour twice as fast as the fastest jet many times there's targets of opportunity and you have very little time to deal with those targets the system that can fly four thousand miles per hour from the continental United States has the ability to engage those targets in a very brief amount of time in less than two hours this extraordinary aircraft is fly 9,000 miles to carry a 12,000 pound payload to the enemy but is such a revolutionary aircraft even possible to find out DARPA chose as one of its partners Lockheed Martin a company that has developed many secret aircraft including the u-2 spy plane and the sr-71 blackbird first aircraft to fly over 2,000 miles per hour their facility called skunk works is famous for its innovation and also for its secrecy the access we're offering here today is really unprecedented this facility has well over a million square feet in just a few windows the reason for that is we want to prevent physical access from people looking inside the windows but also to prevent sounds from being transmitted that sounds could oscillate through the windows and transmit classified or sensitive conversations occasionally we have security areas that require supplemental security protection in this case we have white noise being piped in to prevent classified or highly sensitive discussions from being overheard by a casual passerby few discussions at skunkworks cover subjects as sensitive as this one a bold new aircraft concept design known as the HTV 3x Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne has the formidable challenge of developing the scramjet engine a scramjet is purely a supersonic combustion ramjet to put that in perspective it's almost like trying to keep match lit in a hurricane because the speed of the air blowing past it is in fact supersonic instead of being restricted to a launch pad like a missile the HTV 3x will have the game-changing capability to take off and land from any regular runway offering strategic flexibility in a national emergency to take off and land safely on runways calls for a relatively large wing but to fly at very high speeds demands a much smaller wing can we make the control services larger how to create one aircraft to do both poses a double edge design problem we recently returned from the Lockheed Martin low-speed wind tunnel where we tested our low speed aerodynamics for the HTV 3x low speed testing for the falcon program is part of making Falcon an airplane as opposed to a missile an aircraft must take off and land gracefully which means it must fly at low speeds to use existing runways and so therefore low-speed testing of these high-speed configurations is critical let's get back together two days and let's see what we got we bought from there the details of the Falcon project remain a closely guarded secret and DARPA scientists intend to keep them that way while DARPA enhances our potential for hypersonic flight they also set their sights on helping our combat swimmers these war fighters often swim long distances to shore before entering combat and risk arriving too exhausted to safely complete their mission in the animal world there are some extremely efficient swimmers and we started looking at those animals to learn how they swim and see if we can transfer the methods that they use over to people this is a pretty close copy of a penguin way elliptical in profile it was actually a failure didn't work at all in this case this wing is very similar to what you'd find on the back of a whale on his tail very efficient very hard to manufacture so we actually designed it out finally this wing has the aspect ratio of the whale's tail wing without the bumps on the front this is our finished wing our finished product here is something easy to produce but performs just as well as a nature inspired wing the resulting device called power swim harnesses human muscle for swimming as never before with swim fins a combat swimmer burns 400 calories an hour but with power swim he burns less than 100 DARPA program manager J Lowell shows how the power swim device operates the way this works is you buckle this into your leg you have these Springs that help maintain the angle of attack of the wing appropriately in this back stabilizer foil which gives your use something to kind of push against with your lower part of your leg and you're essentially going to bend your knees and drive this spar away from and towards your body when you're doing that the foils are catching the water it propels the whole device forward at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Maryland J Lowell has set up a speed comparison test a diver using power swim against a barefoot diver and one with swim fins the three swimmers move into position for the race an underwater signal serves as the starting button like a shot is taken from the start the diver with power swim finishes first the one with swim fins is left behind and the barefoot one isn't even close the reason we feel that the power swim device is a very significant advance that perhaps the most significant propulsion advance since the swim fin is that we've managed to improve the efficiency of that diver from 10 percent to 75 percent efficient anything that we can give the Marine that will get him to shore 50% faster while we're reducing his workload 50 percent is going to ensure that he is completely mission capable when he reaches that shore power swim allows combat divers to swim up to twice as fast and four or five times farther than before without getting tired it means they can be dropped off at greater distances from shore so they're less likely to be detected by the enemy but this creates another problem because they're farther out at sea combat swimmers face a higher risk of getting lost and it's imperative they know exactly where they are at all times to solve this new DARPA hard problem the agency developed another breakthrough the tactical underwater navigation system or tons the tons unit combines an advanced compass and depth gauge with a state-of-the-art sonar system giving the warfighter his exact position at all times the thing that's nice about DARPA is is there's no limits to what you can try the sky's the limit and no idea is a stupid idea and so all that does is set all these projects up for success in the long run because they listen to everybody DARPA innovations enable our combat swimmers to steer a safe course through hostile waters and in Iraq DARPA is helping our war fighters to face their deadliest threat improvised explosive devices or IEDs have killed over 1,700 Americans and wounded many more they can be buried by the side of the road hidden in ordinary objects and triggered by cellphones IEDs pose an invisible and ever-present danger the DARPA heart problem locate these explosive devices without setting foot inside the deadly blast radius DARPA solution the math for micro air vehicle when the Mavs successful flight test was first publicized I got a call from a warfighter currently deployed who said we need that now the MAV was developed to have a unique hover and stair capability they really needed something that would allow them to see over the next hill or around the next corner the ability to go to a target area and persistently stare at that area and give them situational awareness weighing only four pounds the Mavs remarkable motor delivers as much power as a 25 pound lawnmower engine and literally sucks the MAV through the air air is sucked into that duct by this fan that's creating the aerodynamic lift the ducted fan air vehicle configuration provides vertical flight capability plus it has no exposed moving parts for safety around soldiers Marines and airmen it can actually fly backwards forwards anything it needs to do to compensate for the wind and to put its sensor on on its target the MAV sensors include a camera that can detect and recognize man-sized targets at more than 800 feet in daylight and more than 400 feet at ninth but today Honeywell program manager Vaughn Fulton and his team will determine whether the MAV can locate a much smaller target a concealed simulated ie D in a nearby control center technicians monitor the mass data we're gonna simulate there's a suspicious device using its heat sensitive infrared camera the math can detect the temperature differential between the ground and an alien object in the dirt they spot their target the mavs infrared camera detects what the naked eye the man brings a game-changing technology to the battlefield something the enemy has not seen before and a capability they're not ready to combat our troops face another deadly threat and unlike IEDs this one's not man-made with temperatures in Iraq and Afghanistan that can reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit sometimes the environment itself is the enemy thousands of our troops have suffered from heat exhaustion DARPA likes to support projects that will be game changers in other words give us a real advantage and if you talk to any soldier who has been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan you ask them what is the major limiting factor for their activities over there they'll say heat heat can limit physical performance and hamper judgment and unless the body is quickly cooled heat stroke can lead to brain damage or death at a Stanford University lab scientists dennis grande and craig heller have developed a remarkable breakthrough we have to be able to run experiments under realistic conditions we're not in Iraq so we have a hot room and then we simulate battle conditions by the clothing that is worn a biological chemical warfare suit heavily insulated for protection offers the worst case scenario for overheating in battle now what this is is going to be a device that will measure your body temperature at the level of your heart because all blood coming back from all regions of the body comes to the heart so that's the best integrated temperature of your body so when you get this all the way up your nose the end of it is going to be right at the level of your heart and for good measure how about a helmet okay so now we're gonna go into the hot room and hot room is at 42 centigrade that's about a hundred and eight Fahrenheit so a nice cool day in the desert okay Steve we use the treadmill here on the Left treadmill up to a 13% grade now pretty good workout well we have Steve exercising in the heat and we're leave him in there exercising until his core temperature gets up to 39 degrees that's about a hundred and two Fahrenheit so would represent a healthy fever when his core temperature reaches 102 degrees Fahrenheit he is even more heavily insulated okay Steve we've now simulated a full biological chemical warfare gear by insulating your hands which would normally be covered with gloves your face and head which would be covered by gas masks goggles helmet and your feet which would be covered by boots how do you feel miserable huh Steve is left to rest in the hot room but his temperature still hovers at a feverish 102 degrees Fahrenheit okay Steve times up so let's let's make you feel a little bit better Craig will cool Steve off using a revolutionary device they call it the glove the gloves are activated so now we can see how much heat we can actually suck out of your hands all right the cool water which is perf using this metal cylinder is going to take heat away from your hands the hot blood is coming into your hand it's being distributed in this big network of blood vessels just under the palm and that heats being transferred to the metal cone the cool blood is going right back to your heart and being distributed through the core of your body feels good even though he is heavily insulated as the cool water circulates through the glove Steve's temperature immediately starts to drop and will soon reach a safe level the glove that can protect warfighters from heatstroke can also save the lives of those suffering from extreme cold including combat swimmers who sometimes spend eight hours in freezing water to perform a mission how are you feeling at this point feeling a little bit cold Dennis Kron is testing whether he can stop research assistant Tim Wolfe from shivering even in the chill of an ice bath that simulates the extreme cold a combat swimmer must survive let me see your hands here yeah you can feel they've pretty much closed down let's take a look at the palm on the infrared here your face is cooling off pretty well your nose definitely shut down can you reach over and feel your ears compared to this rest of the skin temperature and they're very much colder your core temperature is starting to fall down now and you can see it's a pretty decent decline so I think that it's about time to start putting some heat in and see what happens with that plane will that work for you the way we're gonna do it is stick your hand into this little device here that creates a slight negative pressure what that does is it draws blood into your hand and so you've got your arterial blood flow out through here being warmed up in these heat exchangers then going right back to your body core where it's circulating around and the heart delivers it to the core organs okay and you look on the infrared you can see little spots on your arms are starting to warm up like right there and your elbow region superficial veins are starting to light up as the warm blood returning to the heart is warming the tissues as it passes it only took about 30 seconds in a minute before I started to feel a lot more comfortable I feel a little cold still but I'm not sure right which is a good thing I think that this was a real situation and I was really stuck in cold water like this that these things will be a real lifesaver as dangerous as the physical stress of extreme environments is the mental stress of combat there too DARPA readies the warfighter to step into harm's way Applause to help our troops prevail in a second-by-second ordeal of combat DARPA experts have developed a remarkable innovation in mission rehearsal you're being transported out to the area on the way there you open up your laptop and now you see a full 3d recreation of the area you're going to be in you've never been there before it's been built up for actually accurate data so that when you land on on the ground it feels like you've already been there before the real world 3d simulation combines the latest satellite data ground photographs and drone footage for a depiction of the combat site so accurate the warfighter can rehearse his mission as never before just the ability to be able to travel the terrain in a mission set in a virtual environment is invaluable walking training never seen before has its own hazards but if I could have just the rehearsal of walking the terrain that's tremendous the real-world 3d simulation gives the warfighter an extra edge to avoid deadly surprises in combat another critical operation for troops is intelligence gathering through surveillance missions but flying over enemy territory is extremely dangerous a recent DARPA breakthrough the a 160 can conduct surveillance at high altitude over long distances without placing a human life at risk the a 160 does not have a pilot in the traditional sense the people in the ground control station including myself have control over the bird through a data link where we give it air speed heading velocity commands the pilotless a 160 can hover at 20,000 feet and has set a world record for a helicopter of its size flying 18.7 hours without refueling a 160 is is clearly a game-changer its ability to take off and land vertically and it's very very long endure since high altitude operation gathers together a set of capabilities that no other aircraft has ever had before today at a secure landing field in Victorville California the a1 60 will be tested carrying a payload that is itself a breakthrough a radar system called Forrester the Foresters most impressive capability is the ability to see through a number of layers of tree foliage single double canopy will go through that like a hot knife through butter so any place where people can hide in foliage we can find today's flight test will assess whether the a 160 can safely rotate the massive forest or antenna can the a 160 deploy the antenna for radar detection at various angles without endangering its stability in flight the aircraft is towed into positions the technicians await the take-off command shadowed by a chase helicopter the a 160 carrying the Forester antennae who climbs to its programmed altitude for the test to begin altitude 5000 feet can the pilotless aircraft remains stable as it deploys the radar antenna for the first time subjecting the aircraft to maximum torque it's time to find out the radar antenna is deployed the test director delivers the official verdict the antenna was rotated a full plus minus 180 degrees and we flew the antenna out at 90 degrees as well so a lot of good data was captured today's flight completed a lot of the unknown territory and questions we had with the antenna installed on the a1 60 we're very very pleased with the performance the flight test determined that the a 160 could safely deploy the forrester antenna at any angle without endangering the aircraft stability the a 160 can be operated in the fully autonomous mode where we give it a mission plan and then it goes through and execute those commands with no input from the operator capable of flying complex missions without a pilot the a 160 can carry a thousand pound payload weapons supplies and more it has the potential to go in and perhaps rescue somebody from a situation that you wouldn't be able to get a person out of otherwise the aircraft could fly an autonomously perhaps get that person out and bring them back to safety no matter how complex the technology the a 160 like many DARPA innovations as a simple goal to save lives for 50 years no idea has been dismissed as impossible if it could protect America's war fighters and keep surprise on our side in the next 50 years the people who know DARPA secrets can only hint at the surprises to come there are many game changes that we're working on some are as as dramatic as having aircraft that stay up for five years what I see happening in the future is that you'll take precision bring it down with us to the level of a bullet where you actually guide a bullet through flight and change course to the target aircraft which which reconfigure themselves in flight they do it automatically perhaps little bird like they changed their winger configuration they can maneuver in ways that we've not done it in the past many of the things darker works on a classified so we can't tell you what they are but what I can tell you is many of those developments are gonna change our lives in the past 50 years among its many breakthroughs DARPA helps bring us the Internet GPS and stealth technology today in the high-stakes struggle between nations DARPA is still an agency with a mission to make sure that we reach the future first several occasions where the system didn't work as planned and the RPG did go high order and destroyed all of our apparatus and you just pick up the pieces in this case literally pick up the pieces and you push on in June 2008 the iron curtain system is tested again with live fire we had a lot of confidence in the system although I won't say that my heart wasn't up here we took a shot we detected with the radar the optical system went on told our countermeasure where to shoot we shot it held our breath and sure enough we've done at the RPG when over wiped the RDX that explosive off the vehicle and congratulate ourselves and on that particular Humvee we only had 3/8 inch armor which isn't much and we shot five RPGs at it so you can see impact points of five RPGs on that vehicle and we've obviously we've done at the mall we still have our vehicle what exactly is the countermeasure dropping to disable the RPG that remains DARPA secret and behind the scenes DARPA found a way to give our warfighters a futuristic helping hand on patrol in Iraq America's soldiers can fall prey to sniper fire to shield themselves our warfighters must rely on 30 pounds of body armor for protection with the rest of their gear they must shoulder as much as 125 pounds to give them the extra strength they need DARPA goes to a place where fact meets science fiction scientist Steve Jacobson at raytheon-sarcos and lockheed ii is working to create a new breed of soldier with superhuman powers his creation the exoskeleton combines a man and a machine to offer extraordinary strength if you put 200 pounds of body armor on somebody right now they're gonna walk about 300 feet if you put 200 pounds of aren't body armor on somebody wearing an exoskeleton they can walk all day the exoskeleton mirrors the human body a computer network serves as its nervous system hydraulic valves and actuators function as muscles and its skeleton is made of aluminum the challenge of putting a person inside a machine is a daunting one know when you put a machine around person there's all sorts of places where it interferes with emotion it may have braids your skin when you first put it on and it's not powered up it feels very heavy because you're wearing a 200 pound robot which is a lot of weight already to power up power up as soon as they power it up all that weight goes away and suddenly you feel like Rex Jamison where's what is probably the most advanced design currently being tested by a human operator the risk is that it's extraordinarily fast and extraordinarily strong so if it decides to do something you know I can't fight it the exoskeleton is designed to amplify the operators movement without blocking it to read his motion enhance it and make him stronger the superhuman stamina of the exoskeleton makes it a priceless military asset it will allow a soldier to lift 100 pounds with no more effort than lifting 10 when I'm lifting heavy things with the exoskeleton it's surprising you look at the object and your brain thinks you can't pick that up you don't feel any stronger than exascale them but then then you reach out to pick it up and there's no effort at all and it continually surprises me it feels like I'm lifting a problem how much load are you fill in and pulling 200 pounds moving things is one of the large forgotten jobs in the military and the exoskeleton was designed to help an individual soldier move boxes all day long without getting tired 35 pound ammunition can you know a normal man can lift without much problem but after lifting 20 of them they're gonna get really tired and it requires no effort on my part so I could do it forever basically by reducing fatigue the exoskeleton can enhance the combat performance of the warfighter and the exoskeleton is more than strong it's light on its feet the fun part for me about operating extra filament are they speed moves like punching bag and soccer ball it's very quick and very precise and surprising given how much power it has how I can follow you so quickly the exoskeleton is the best robot in the world right now because there's no other robot in the world that you can climb in to move really do work and not get tired one of the joys of the exoskeleton is watching someone's face who sees it for the first time because to them this has been science fiction but all of a sudden science fiction is real they see a machine on the person and they know tomorrow's here the army is adapting the exoskeleton for supply handling to help our troops bear the burdens of war but strength and stamina are not enough a war fighters survival depends on locating the enemy a new DARPA breakthrough answers that need for our troops survival means spotting an enemy sniper on a rooftop before he spots you when Iraq started it was very clear in the urban area and that what people really wanted was surveillance but they didn't want it from ten miles away they just wanted to know what was on the next block DARPA solution the wasp it's no bigger than a toy but looks can be deceiving the thing I think that makes wasps so unique is it has all the same features that are found in a full-size airplane it has an altimeter it has a gyro it has GPS it has a magnetometer all of these things that are found in full-size airplanes are found in a package less than 26 inches and weighs at less than a pound each stage or block of the wasp produced by the Aero vironment corporation was supervised by DARPA program manager Leo Christodoulou this is the block 3 production aircraft this aircraft has multiple capability with modular payloads such as this one which is a high-resolution camera but he could also have a night-vision camera or indeed he could have an extra battery to give it increased endurance think of it as airborne binoculars for the infantry it has the capability to accomplish complex missions with high degree of autonomy in cases where it loses communication and has no instructions you will go to a rally point it will go to a specific location in wait for you there the wasp has already proved effective on covert combat missions where it can be used to help detect snipers for terrorist hideouts one of the key design objectives of the wasp was the ability for a single warfighter to quickly efficiently and easily assemble it and fly in in very short order what I have in the backpack here as a micro air vehicle that a single man can operate here's the air vehicle itself this is a night camera this is the camera we use for flying in the day this is the controller I use to view the video and control the aircraft in Wilson flight and this is the RF unit which sends up the command to the aircraft and then receives video I'm here at a test range in California we're gonna send this what if American War fighters could stop a rocket-propelled grenade spot the enemy with binoculars in the sky March all day with superhuman strength swim twice as fast with half the effort sound impossible one shadowy US agency is making all this and more DARPA the agency that's America's secret weapon for US forces it's a dangerous world out there but the American warfighter has someone watching his back even though he may never have heard the name drive past this complex on a street near Washington DC and it looks like any other office building there's no logo on the outside no hint to who works here DARPA the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency it's the R&D arm of the Defense Department DARPA enables the game-changing military breakthroughs that others dismiss as impossible if I have an idea for a new tank DARPA is not going to be interested in that they're gonna say go to a company that makes tanks but if I have an idea for a hover tank or an invisible tank and I can show a reasonable scientific plan to get to that end goal DARPA is the one who's gonna fund that DARPA has granted National Geographic filmmakers unprecedented access to closely guarded labs remote proving grounds and underwater test areas at DARPA headquarters we surrender our cell phones at the visitor control center badge then we are escorted to the only room where interviews can be conducted sometimes our questions hit a brick wall you know I don't go down that road the security reason don't want to tell you the secret sauce um yeah can i no talk about that let's not talk about that fun for now from developing ways to spot hidden threats in Iraq to designing hypersonic jets that can fly more than five times the speed of sound DARPA tackles what they called DARPA hard problems looking at a problem that's really difficult you just say that's too hard to do and if you if you answer the question like that then it's a DARPA heart problem the highest risk possible is when you put resources on something and you have no idea whether it's going to happen those are DARPA heart problems the problems that are too hard to solve DARPA hard we kill them the world faces a new kind of terror that has transformed the nature of combat America's war fighters have an urgent need for new weapons and defenses to fight a hidden enemy whose attacks are unexpected and deadly case in point how to defend our troops against rocket-propelled grenades in Iraq RPGs are a leading cause of combat death they are cheap to make fast RPG armored vehicles somewhere out on the range way out there and I'm gonna find it with this the target vehicle doesn't stop until it's far beyond his line-of-sight lost in the distance okay I've done the pre-flight system checks are good and we're gonna launch the vehicle and go find that guy powered by an electric motor the wasp block 3 can travel at a speed of up to 40 miles per hour it's capable of flying for 45 minutes to a distance as far as three miles away from its operator so I'm looking down the road here and we're just seeing where you might have gone or look at the side left and right and I'll just keep looking around ever inside view camera here and I'm just looking to see you if you can find him there is there's the vehicle we were able to find the vehicle even more surprising than how well the wasp flies is the way it lands when the wasp lands it's designed to break apart in order to absorb air energy very much like a NASCAR is designed to break apart when they crash that's the way we design our UAVs such that when they break apart the energy of the zorb the piece parts may fall apart but then you can pick them up and you can put the airplane right back together again and it's ready to fly Applause not only was it darker hard technologically but he was DARPA fast in terms of getting it into the hands of the operators we needed to turn this aircraft into a robust tough little bird that could take everything that the warfighter my family with the wasp DARPA helps put the element of surprise on our side and surprise has always been part of DARPA DNA since a day that shook the world DARPA was founded when one of our enemies took us by surprise 50 years ago we had Sputnik launched by the Russians which greatly surprised this country we never believed that they were going to get to space first darphus primary mission from the very beginning this would be an agency whose job is to prevent technological surprise to the United States over the years we have found that the best way to prevent technological surprise is to create it so we have gone out and created surprise in order to prevent it from happening to us DARPA gave America the high-tech edge with breakthroughs like the Saturn moon rocket that began as a DARPA program and stealth technology the reason you have a GPS receiver the reason you have cellphones so small because DARPA created the technology many years ago many other innovations that DARPA helped to pioneer from the computer mouse to the Internet have transformed our lives DARPA has been involved from the very beginning in enabling technologies if we could have a sticker it would say DARPA inside and and that sticker would go to every high-technology product there probably is DARPA is quest for advanced technology ratcheted up after the deadly attacks of 9/11 suddenly we faced a determined and elusive enemy who posed an unnerving new threat I actually worked in the Pentagon at the time and after 9/11 word came down that it was imperative that we had systems that could get places fast over long distances DARPA envisioned a game-changer that could fly over 4,000 miles per hour twice as fast as the fastest jet Mini's can be fired from anywhere and race to their targets in seconds a seemingly unstoppable threat DARPA solution a revolutionary technology called Iron Curtain an Iron Curtain was developed to protect lives lives of people in armored vehicles line armored vehicles against threats such as Rockapella grenades many RPGs are so powerful they can penetrate a concrete wall or a foot of solid steel it takes an RPG about a tenth of a second to travel 15 yards to its target darphus team has to develop something fast and powerful enough to detect track and destroy it in a split second just inches from the vehicle itself but can it be done at a remote site on the Utah Salt Flats scientists prepare to test the iron curtain system on an armored Humvee it's about to be subjected to an attack by simulated RPG fire as the RPG is flying in the first sensor that sees it is the radar this is the radar antenna so they can track the RPG as it comes in the second sensor that sees it is there's all along here there's an optical sensor and as the RPG flies underneath we're able to select at the exact aim point the countermeasure then has an effect on the exact point that you want it to now since we can't have explosive countermeasures on the test that we're doing out here today we use instead a system that we call the diode gun and we set up the lights in sequence so that they travel down at the exact same speed that the countermeasure would be going so we can see then with the high-speed camera that's operating at about 30,000 frames per second we can see precisely where the countermeasure would have hit the RPG today's test will require pinpoint radar detection of the incoming threat and an instant trigger of the countermeasure system before the test the equipment must be calibrated they aim the air cannon precisely using a laser okay that's good a little bit to the right that looks good we have an autonomous system that's GPS guided the guide system around the track so that we can conduct our experiments completely unmanned in three two one go all right let's watch the high-speed only by examining the data can technicians tell if Iron Curtain worked in the critical time frame required footage shot by their high-speed camera indicates that the sensors detected the incoming RPG threat the countermeasures would have effectively been deployed in time to stop the RPG in about 1/10 of a second the Utah test of the iron curtain system using simulated RPGs is a success but can Iron Curtain stop deadly live RPG fire in the case of Iron Curtain we have had"

history tells us that adolf hitler demented betrayed and um lacking in any hope of victory at all retires to his private courses in the bunker with his wife ava brown and they commit suicide ava brown probably taking a cyanide capsule hitler by shooting himself in the head those bodies are then carried upstairs and are put in a shallow grave covered in 50 liters of petrol set ablaze and that's it end of history end of hitler the first anyone knew of hitler's death was on may the 1st 1945 when german radio made a dramatic announcement it was the first clue says gerard williams that the death of adolf hitler wasn't what it appeared hitler's death is not announced by the allies finding his body hitler's death is announced by the german government by the nazis the problem with that is this is one of the greatest propagandist nations ever to run the earth hitler's dead say that's not season and we are just meant to believe it despite the radio report the allies were unable to verify hitler's death at the time of the announcement the battle of berlin was still raging a day after the broadcast on may the 2nd 1945 the soviet army accompanied by a bbc reporter finally seized hitler's bunker and made a grim discovery they found the body of a man with a lock of black hair on the right hand side of his face and a little black moustache at first glance it looked like the nazi leader but it was soon established that it wasn't and they looked at them more closely and their doctors came to the conclusion that it was what they call a bad double of hitler and not hitler himself body doubles were widely used in the second world war stalin was known to have numerous and churchill at least one historians are certain that hitler used them too it's not clear if the dead man was a hitler body double or not but the fact is no one reported finding the body of the real adolf hitler in 1945 i'm pretty convinced that two people probably did die in the bunker at the end of april beginning of may 1945 but they weren't out of hitler and over brown hitler and ava are substituted in the dying days of the bunker in berlin two double replaced them and it was those who were murdered and their bodies disposed of later the conspiracy would have us believe that this audacious switch was masterminded by hitler's private secretary martin bormann to get to hitler at any level at all you had to go through martin borman borman controlled the door he was the gatekeeper to him a committed nazi borman was determined to see his beloved fuhrer survive the war born is a very committed personally to adolf hitler he's his friend he's his leader he's his fuhrer and he wants to see him live what he realizes is that if he wants to keep his friend alive and he wants to keep himself alive is that they have to die there has to be a final end to them there has to be no reason for people to come looking for them i believe that at the end of april 1945 the real hitler along with ava brown was spirited out of the bunker to the right chancery and that's where the exchange took place the body doubles come back and it's done it's a slightest hand gerard williams maintains that only bormann and gestapo chief heinrich muller knew about the switch the people who would have seen body doubles in the bunker for the short period that remained while they were still alive would have caught fleeting glimpses of hitler in his uniform over in her cotton dress they would not have got close and when word reached bormann that the real adolf hitler and ava brown had successfully escaped the body doubles were executed so if hitler didn't die in 1945 where did he go the rumors everywhere oh you can see in a lot of the sort of gutter yellow papers of the time in america and in britain there'll be rumors of hitler being discovered in the antarctic the incredible theory proposed by renegade historian douglas dietrich is that the nazis built a secret colony in the south pole what was established was basing for initially two hundred thousand aryans constructed with underground factory systems underground hospitals uh even daycare facilities in which the nazi leadership would retreat and be defended by a resistance movement and the remainder of its forces the creation of such a massive fortress in antarctica may seem fantastical but vast underground tunnels discovered in austria at the end of the war are some believe proof that the idea isn't as far-fetched as it sounds this site is possibly the third reich's biggest underground site with an area of around a million square meters amateur historian andreas villa has explored this nazi tunnel complex in austria that was built to accommodate 60 000 men in 1938 the nazis did send a team to the south pole they said it was for scientific purposes but the man in charge of the mission was no scientist it was hermann goering the chief of the german air force one of the reasons for the germans going to antarctica was to acquire territory because they had imperial ambitions germany felt that it had the right to claim a piece of antarctica as its own territory but why commandeer land in one of the most inhospitable places in the world douglas dietrich thinks he knows the answer the major point of that expedition was to establish the feasibility of long-term colonization of the last truly unexplored continent on earth fueling this idea that the nazi's plan to build a stronghold in the south pole is a boast made by a top-ranking nazi in 1943. admiral dernitz the commander of the german u-boat fleet is reported to have openly talked about an impregnable fortress in another part of the world that he claimed to have built for hitler it would seem to me if if he had built such a base it'd be much more likely to be in greenland than it would be in antarctica simply because that's the theater of war in which germany was fighting its major battles not in antarctica which was several tens of thousands of miles away but the conspiracy theorists disagree they say the arrival of two u-boats in argentina a staging post for the south pole in june 1945 two months after the end of the war is evidence that dernitz fortress was in antarctica you 
denver colorado is home to america's largest airport called the denver new world airport the airport was built by freemasons in 1995 and features a free masonic dedication capstone in the atrium a time capsule is buried underneath the stone to be opened in the year 2094. the new world denver airport has a swastika-shaped runway there is reportedly a deep underground military base beneath the airport with miles and miles of secret subterranean tunnels connected to a large network of underground cities as passengers drive up to the main airport terminal they are greeted by a sinister looking 32 foot high fiberglass blue stallion with veins popping out of its body and demonic eyes that glow bright red not exactly a common influence for travelers who are already spooked about getting on a plane the sculpture is believed to symbolize the pale horse of the apocalypse mentioned in the bible whose name is death the sculptor luis jimenez was killed by the horse when a chunk of the sculpture broke loose and came crashing down on him locals call the horse lucifer inside the airport travelers hurry past grotesque gargoyles in suitcases that leer down at them and morbid apocalyptic murals that line the airport walls at the main gate four panels of giant-sized wall murals in the baggage claim area tell a terrifying and prophetic story and pictures of how humanity's future is going to unfold the first mural reveals a horrific darth vader-like figure wearing a nazi general uniform and a gas mask the gas mask indicates that the next war will use depopulating biological or chemical agents the white dove that he is killing symbolizes peace on the right are destroyed buildings reminiscent of the twin towers the nazi general scimitar sword has been swished through the air leaving behind a rainbow chemtrail that poisons the air and ethnic population below it on the left is an endless line of weeping women refugees holding dead babies there is no trace whatsoever of violence to the dead children who appear to have died from the deadly gas of the toxic rainbow why are there no men present presumably they have all been killed the nazi general scimitar sword that destroys peace is a symbol used by the shriners who are freemasons freemasonry is a fraternity within a fraternity outwardly it is a friendly charitable organization that conceals an inner brotherhood of the 33rd degree elect the next airport mural shows a forest and a city in flames the world's endangered animals and plants are extinct buffaloes whales leopards elephants and sea turtles the sickly haze and leaping flames suggest a nuclear or biochemical devastation children are the only survivors and they are weeping over three open caskets of an african girl on the left a native girl in the center and a white judeo-christian girl on the right they represent the death of the old black red and white root races to make way for the new world race the dead white girl in the coffin holds a bible and a yellow judean star which was used by the nazis to identify jews it symbolizes the death of judeo-christian beliefs another child holds a mayan tablet depicting the end of the mayan calendar and the end of the world as we know it in the third mural the apocalyptic war has ended children of all nations are joyfully giving up their nation's sovereignty to the blond-haired blue-eyed german boy at the center they are all turning over their weapons wrapped in their country's national flag to the german boy the bavarian jacket leaves no doubt whatsoever that the

all right class is in session once again and i am honored and privileged uh to be in the presence of someone i've been so anxious to speak with and learn from and dive in create some discourse uh doctor of clinical psychology and certified school psychologist activist lecturer leader teacher professor the list goes on uh author of psychoacademic holocaust the special education and adhd wars against black boys uh the one and only dr umar johnson my brother he's in black power good to see you man come on man had to get to it absolutely absolutely we talked about it for uh some time and i've you know been a fan of your wisdom and your knowledge and your movement uh and your outspokenness you know what i mean on so many different platforms i've seen you go toe to toe head to head with with the best and um and really just being unapologetic and as you know you could call it unapologetically african yes sir yes sir where did that come from where does that like ultimately like this this drive to to feed our people and to be so strong uh in in your in your rhetoric when i was in the uh third grade we lived in north carolina my father was in the marine corps okay and it was in north carolina that i decided i wanted to be a psychologist okay i was the oldest boy didn't have an older brother right so i said i wanted to be the older brother that other children could talk to wow if they had problems got it so when we moved back to philadelphia mead elementary school which is in the heart of north philly the ghetto we had a black history class which was mandatory by the way yeah so i thought black history was required because it was for us right right so our black history teacher was a sister by the name of mrs green and mrs green really planted in us a love for self and a love for knowledge of self so in many respects i am an example of what happens when you're taught who you are at an early age so fourth and fifth grade was black history that was elementary school but then right around the corner was the philadelphia division of marcus garvey's unia okay okay and so when i graduated from college i joined the garvey movement and it was at the garvey movement where the elders continued to plant that seed that was originally inculcated by mrs green around the corner but almost 20 years earlier i'm a true product of the political struggle of north philadelphia right and being a school psychologist was a unique caveat to the freedom struggle because there were no other black male school psychologists in the freedom struggle right so the elders at the garvey movement in philadelphia sunday mass meetings which they've been holding since garvey started the organization in jamaica 1914 sunday's at three o'clock over 100 years now wow so they would always ask me to stand up and talk about what school psychologists do right really because there was no other items on the agenda so i was filler yeah i was the only young member and i was filler so i would get up and talk about ritalin adderall adhd the learning disabilities autism a lot of people hadn't heard of school psychology yeah okay so it was my job to help educate them on that and then people would come to the meetings and they would just start asking me to come speak other places yeah you mind coming to my black history program my university my community college would you pop in on my kwanzaa celebration so literally it was word of mouth yeah that kind of got me started but it all began with the garvey movement the unapologetically african movement was something i began back in 20 i want to say 2012 2013 and i started that once again a spin-off from garveyism that teaches black pride love of self not a hate for no one else but an appreciation for who we are our uniqueness right and in being a psychologist being a school psychologist and studying african behavior particularly when we get around other cultural groups i saw that we began to shy away from who we were we began to imitate something that we were not we felt ashamed of our hair our skin the way we walk talk our food right and i'm like are you kidding almost 400 years since we've been here under white oppression right you've been here longer but under wide oppression under this government 400 years and we're still afraid to be who we are right so i came up with unapologetically african to say that we have a right to exist we have a right to our uniqueness and we have a right to push and proliferate our own unique african cultural contribution to human experience right so what do you think the moment was or the movement uh was where the notoriety came nationally and globally what was that what set it off that set off in 2010 i was invited to come to chicago to do a public access television interview on chicago's public access network and um a brother called me up he said listen somebody just sent me an article you wrote on the scooter prison pipeline it was powerful i need you to come up here i can't get you up here but if you can get up here we can make this happen right so i said chicago that's the second largest black city i got to handle this yeah so i went up there we did the interview and it's amazing it's interesting how destiny works because he only had one copy of the dvd of the interview yeah and i said i need a copy of that i just needed a copy i didn't know why but i said i needed a copy of that he said this is my only one but he said you know what i'ma give it to you because i can get another one next week yeah so he gave me that dvd had he not given me that dvd we may not even be here now because what happens is three weeks later i speak in new york city for the first time harlem right now i've spoken in new york before but it was strictly for the garvey movement never a public lecture of my own right so at the national black theater 125th and fifth i broke copies of the chicago interview um so you see these are the largest black cities right and so when it comes to my rise within black consciousness i really have to hang my hat on the support i got from new york city in chicago yeah yeah because it was the chicago interview and then the new york lecture once i did that lecture i'll never forget it october 30th 2010 it was the night before halloween it was a nice turnout uh but i didn't think nothing of it i'm just doing what i do yeah getting the information out and literally brother when i tell you within 48 hours i was a household name wow 48 hours i was a household name like my phone was just ringing non-stop non-stop 2011 came i think i did an interview at least once every day for 365 days wow it just it caught me by surprise yeah i was in philly working as a school psychologist doing my thing and then the invitation started coming and i said okay you got to make a decision because this is taking you away from your practice right right so i evaluate children for special ed i can't do that and travel right so i decided to sacrifice the testing and do the traveling and it was a good decision because i was able to help push the message not only the pan-african message but also the school-to-prison pipeline message to tell parents stop getting your children tested stop putting them on ritalin stop buying into these diagnosis because they're not solutions they are feeding the school-to-prison pipeline right and and i mean that's been one of your strong messages and i tapped into it uh pretty pretty early just based off of feeling like i i was almost a part of that pipeline somebody that you know second grade diagnosed with adhd you know uh was my family was challenged to put me on some type of medication but otherwise they they did they gave me some it was interesting they gave me another type of test that i actually scored uh the third highest in the nation and then so from that process of thinking like something might be wrong with this child it then implemented me into the gate program in california with the gifted and talented education and from there you know even my grandmother having that foresight uh that man maybe if we challenge him you know he's he he won't act out in that certain way so be getting to getting me involved in everything from you know other languages and music and and for there it's like it's a simple concept for me it's like you know a lot of us we don't have learning disabilities but we're so far advanced absolutely uh in our understanding in our movement that we're just not challenged absolutely in fact you just basically explain what's really going on with black boys and so-called adhd it's not an overactive brain it's above average intelligence you see the issue is that public school is not designed to identify black boys who are gifted the gifted movement was started in the aftermath of school desegregation 1954 to re-segregate black kids from white kids so after the supreme court said you can't use race to separate the students anymore white power said well we need a new excuse right so they invented the mentally gifted movement right so instead of saying we're putting a black child in the separate class or putting the white child in a separate class because they're black or white we're excluding the white kid from the black class because they're too intelligent so it's not about race wow it's about intelligence right so mg became the new strategy to re-segregate the students wow you see yeah so if we're using giftedness to explain away black kids away from the white kids we can't possibly use giftedness to help support black children right but the problem with mg nick is that not all the white kids are gifted either right right yeah so even though you were helping some of them get out a lot of them weren't smart enough to qualify right then they had another problem they said but what about the ones who don't make it right they still don't want them learning with the black kids right so that's when they invented the learning disability but in my work at least half the black boys i've ever evaluated were mentally gifted not adhd but the school has a one-track mind they are trained to look for problems not talents right one more point today mental giftedness used to be part of special ed law that means what special ed is money right whenever i say a kid is __ autistic emotionally disturbed reading disabled math disabled their name goes into a computer that goes to the state department of education they get a welfare check by the end of the month for that child that school does the school day special ed is money right special ed is money it ain't about helping nobody wow now gifted used to be in there that means what when you were tested for gifted and qualified right your school district got money for you wow right yeah but when former president george w bush reauthorized special ed law in o4 actually before he reauthorized it back in 97 i want to say they took mg out of special ed law that means what you no longer get money for identifying smart black children right since they've taken that out if you look at the gifted rates of blackheads is almost non-existent wow __ up here reading disabled up here adhd up head mg all the way down here and it's even worse now because they're not being subsidized to find the talented black voice wow so that brings up an interesting point that you discuss in your book about labeling um on both ends of the spectrum you know what i mean like a kid being gifted a kid uh having mental illness at some point yourself being a child psychologist you have to actually apply those labels to different individuals just that concept of you know compartmentalizing children um ultimately is is that helpful or ultimately it's very unethical to me it's a human rights abuse and i would even argue that the mental health exploitation of black children and the miseducation of black children not only constitutes a modern day holocaust i think it's one of the greatest examples of human rights abuse in the world today like we we hear about the genocides and we hear about hunger and we hear about political oppression what about the miseducation and mental health exploitation of black children it's right up there right but to your point three reasons i have an issue with child mental health even though i'm in child mental health issue number one children are not self-referred for therapy what does that mean if i'm eight years old right and somebody says i need an adhd evaluation because i'm too hyper or i cannot focus did i ask for that evaluation how many third grade black boys have you seen go looking for medication right you they don't right it's the adults who are inconvenienced by the child who say he needs to be tested you see that he's looking for no medicine yeah or no therapy he loves being who he is right so the first ethical issue is children don't refer themselves right it's adults that force them to get evaluated right it's adults that give them the ritalin the adderall the concerto the vibrance the metadata not the child right so when some people say i'm an adult and i have adhd the medication works for me right that's not a contradiction with the problem i have with childhood psychiatrics because you're an adult so you can refer yourself you can also speak eloquently as to the side effects that medicine is causing in you right but that eight-year-old can express the fact that i can't go to sleep because of this medicine right you know that uh my hunger my appetite is different because of this medicine right you see i'm sleeping too much because of this medicine that child isn't old enough to know that that medicine might affect his ability to have children later on life they don't know that that medicine is beginning to trigger psychotic symptoms right homicidal suicidal ideation so if an adult wants to take medicine that's your prerogative you're an adult you can protect yourself right an eight-year-old cannot the second ethical violation is it's all about the money the american psychiatric association is indebted to the drug companies they run it right do you hear me we talk about politicians being indebted to the corporations well the american psychiatric association is indebted to the drug companies right all of which publicly trade on wall street wow and they fund the diagnosis wow because they create these medications that need to be sold so they can make dividends for the investors right so they go to the apa and say listen we got a new medicine so you got to create a disorder defeat this medicine how much do they make off adhd meds a year 30 billion dollars 30 billion 30 billion dollars a year that's the drug game right it's the drug game speaking of that that's my third issue the drug enforcement agency of america classifies ritalin as a schedule two drug ritalin is in the same category as opium and cocaine this is the government wow ritalin is in the same category as opium and cocaine so let me get this right you got black men going to jail out the wazoo for selling crack right right most black men in jail are there for non-violent drug related offenses right if selling drugs are so bad if using drugs is so bad if it's bad enough to send the boy's father to jail how can it also be good enough to give to his son so he can sit still long enough to learn about helen keller and frank and christopher columbus if drugs are wrong drugs are wrong right you can't say it's wrong for adults to use them but we can give them to children so they can get an education that's the total contradiction crack is crack no matter what name you sell it under ritalin which is methylfinity okay is only a molecule away from crack it has the same side effects as crack ritalin is a molecule away from correct crack cocaine is synthesized coke wow you see so when they talk about you know a mass incarceration of black males and at the same time you're hyper etique hyper medicating black boys look at this you're mass incarcerating black men for selling drugs but you're hyper medicating black boys with the same drug that sent his father to jail right that is hypocrisy absolutely and no one's calling the united states department of education the pharmaceutical industry nobody's calling the american psychiatric association to task because so much money is being made from this nick everybody eats the psychiatrists eat the school eat the clinic eat the therapists eat even the parents can get social security money right everybody is eating off the modern day medical lynching mental health lynching of black boys wow and then the the concept of uh believing our community is uh a sick community or as they say you know it's easier to control a sick population uh and so but then defining what is sick uh has probably always been my issue and it's a very tough thing to do because there's a gray line in other words here's your clearly mental ill people right right and then you have a category of gray where people exhibit some symptoms but is he really conduct disorder is he really bipolar is she really borderline is this really depression you have these grays especially with depression because i feel like everyone has a a a hint of depression or goes through depression in their life at some time absolutely and then there's the actual disorder of oppressive disorder yeah so how do you determine if this is just a regular natural bout of depression that they should be allowed to work through on their own right versus rushing in to diagnose and medicate with the zoloft and the prozac right the drug companies want the psychiatrist and psychologist to rush in and diagnose because if you don't diagnose that script won't get written so they want everybody in the gray area to be included in the area with people who clearly have disability because they need prescriptions to be written right right it's the law of capitalism supply and demand we need a demand for these meds and the only way we're going to get a demand for these meds is if y'all diagnose people who really don't have the problem which is why in most states the psychologists and psychiatrists must diagnose something in order to get paid for the evaluation wow so you come in yeah i know this is just a regular bout of sadness or temporary depression yeah but i don't get my reimbursement from your insurance unless i diagnose you which is why i tell black folks to be careful because if you go sniffing for a diagnosis you're going to get one because most diagnoses that we use can't be proven to exist scientifically you understand when they create the dsm-5 that's the bible where all the diagnoses are yeah that's we talk about that a lot yeah that's not science that's not a scientific manual right they vote on committee oh wow over these disorders so none of that stuff is proven none of it's proven okay there is some research behind it but it's not conclusive right you see it's all about what is socially acceptable and financially lucrative to the drug companies wow so it feels like there's a lot of misappropriation and mental health in the term and even especially now even within our community we find it's almost become a buzzword yes and and you know a lot of drug companies love that yeah and people a lot of people have been accused of marketing mental health and making money even you in times they they would even say like different conversations my brother charlemagne a bunch of people who are actually stepping up and speaking about you know black men having mental health but i see there's this other side that's starting to say yes you know well why are we bringing that up or why are you it's almost calling it an excuse uh or another way to make money how do you feel about that okay if they're both right and they're both wrong we clearly have mental health issues in the black community clearly i know people who've been sexually abused i know people who've been verbally abused physically abused i know people are depressed anxiety disorders schizophrenia bipolar borderline suicide and you know black men and suicide is going through the roof by the way yeah i get a call i probably get six calls a year for black men who are either attempting or have successfully committed suicide this week i've already gotten two calls but this was not black men these was both black women wow so suicide for men and women are going up and suicide is the silent illness because people like to tell that they're suicidal and you don't even know that they were until they're gone right you see so we do have mental health issues the problem is what though nick we don't want those mental health issues to be exploited by the drug companies for profit because the drugs don't solve problems see when you get diagnosed with depression the best way to work with you and i'm a therapist is to talk you through that right let's find out the sources of your depression let's reinterpret them let's give them a meaning in your life that is more empowering than the one you have now let's switch out the beliefs that you associate with your future your past and your current situation let's move you out of that it's going to take some time right but the only way to do it is through traditional talk therapy right but the drug company has bullied the american psychiatric association into saying what everybody who gets diagnosed with depression must take meds you follow me so yes we're going to give you talk therapy but we need you to pop along with those acts right one of these laws why do you need the medicine at all because they got to make sure they get their cut because guess what in it if dr umar nick is a therapist we both therapists and we healing people with no medicine right that is a threat yeah to the profit margin of the drug company right they don't want you talking about we can solve this without the meds so they bullied the mental health system into telling everybody yes you need talk therapy but you also need some medication too here's the other point i want to make psychology has never been the friend of black people what do i mean by that do you realize that the segregation system white supremacy itself was born in the mind of the psychologist it was the psychologist who gave birth to black people are animals white people are gods what i'm saying it was uh uh and all their names are escaping me right now but all of the white fathers of psychology believed in african racial inferiority you've destroyed all of them uh darwin his cousin his cousin i love him so when you say black people need to go to the psychologists i'm saying you're sending them to the same people who engineered the popular beliefs of not only african racial inferiority but who also funded the eugenics movement that seeks to depopulate black people off of the face of this earth under the alleged notion that we have defective dna yeah see when you hear the news talk about are black men born to be violent you hear these conversations maybe they're just maybe this is who they are right that's eugenics eugenics wants to blame political problems okay on ancestral dna right so if nick cannon uh has adhd so called adhd because i don't believe in it right it's because of defective dna if dr umar johnson can't keep a job it ain't because the american social order hasn't created enough jobs for black men it's because he don't feel like working i'm lazy exactly if uh if i beat up my woman it's not because of the stress under which i live it's because uh it's that african chromosome you understand that's triggering that behavior so black people have to be careful because i'm starting to see black folks who mean well buy into this notion that mental illness is genetically programmed that's dangerous right because that's what slavery argued right that these people are backwards not because we made them that way because we have cut them off from any type of formal learning and socialization but because of defective dna feeble-minded absolutely that's that galton that's the sir francis sculpton yeah stock and he's worshipped in psychology he's a god in psychology he's one of the most racist psychologists who ever walked the face of this earth so when you tell us to go to the psychologist i'm concerned about that because psychology helped create the mental mindset that america operates under that is so responsible for so much of the oppression that we face and on top of that when you go to therapy there's a client therapist privilege right right you come to me for therapy i'm not allowed to disclose what you tell me right but there's a caveat right the system says if you say anything that's suggestive of the fact that you're committing child neglect or child abuse i got to report you right so i'm coming to you because i need to talk about these demons right but at the same time you're not telling me that if i say something that is potentially incriminating right you got to report me right and i can end up losing my children right because i came to therapy trying to get some help wow do you see that so for me it is the job of the black psychologists the black social workers the black counselors to evolve a mental health service system where we could solve the mental health issues of our own people because if you send black folks in mass to the white mental health system there's going to be more people it's more energetic more incarceration and more what drug addiction look at look at that you're going to get more drug addicts you're going to get more children snatched from there now the money just ain't going to the dope man it's going to the system the money going to the system you can't send people to get their problems solved by the same people that caused them so what is the answer i mean based off of because if not we'll self-medicate or if it and if the system isn't the answer um i mean obviously we can always say education but for someone a community that's obviously disenfranchised and there's so much going on we we see the resilience that that yes that we've been up against for generations but is there truly an answer or is this just a conversation like hey be aware because this is going going on but i feel like there's if the system's not the answer if if cultural self-determination is the answer let's look at what everybody else does when they come to america when the chinese show up when the arabs show ups when the european jew shows up uh when the mexican shows up the latino shows up the fact that they was already here right but the first thing they do is they create a political economic barricade around their interests right the minute they land they're not trying to integrate or participate fast they're trying to accumulate they're not trying to integrate or participate they want to accumulate right so hey oh atm machine absolutely most cities have a chinatown right most cities have a little italy yeah most cities have a jewish community yeah most cities have a latino community right even in philadelphia i live we're seeing cambodian communities a-rap communities yeah everybody got a town of they own in most major cities but there's no black town in america at all part of that is due to the psychological homelessness that slavery bred into black folks right we are ashamed about being black hence unapologetically african we don't want to be black in other words the one thing that becomes a positive weapon for most cultures right okay is actually a weakness for black people right because since our blackness has been the source of so much of our pain in america the last thing we want to do is rally around it in order to solve our problems right but there is no solution outside of group work there is no solution outside of teamwork any solution we come up with must be implemented systematically by way of the group it cannot be individualism so for example you'll hear people say according to forbes or according to the new york times there's 100 new black millionaires in america as of 2020 right right a negro who's politically uneducated will say that's a good thing there's a hundred more black millionaires but there's 50 million black people in america and very few of those 100 black millionaires are trying to reinvest any of that capital into systematic improvements for the race so how can you say black people are doing better because obama got elected how can you say black people are doing better because him and her are millionaires now no you judge group progress based on the average quality of life for all members of that race not a few negro aristocrats but in america they have convinced black people that progress for the negro aristocracy means progress for the group and that is incorrect yeah they said what the uh black wealth today is the same as it was when slavery ended absolutely when you compare to what white folks have in fact in many respects we've lost ground and we've lost a lot of that ground under a black president obama is not the scapegoat for everything that went wrong in black america but the one thing he must be held responsible for is he did absolutely nothing to impact any of the five major problems that we have as if i said i have that argument with people constantly because they're emotional right right it's like arguing you know was jesus the son of god and it doesn't matter to me whether they believe it or not because i respect our religion yeah if you want to argue whether muhammad ibn abdullah was god's last prophet doesn't matter to me or not because that's religion i'm into political power right yeah if the person is emotional they cannot entertain any logical argument you bring to that equation in fact so when you talk about obama since most black people deal with obamaism as a religion as opposed to a political mistake you can have a healthy conversation and they usually don't they don't have the the understanding or the knowledge of of politics in itself to understand if anything happened under under his reign or not absolutely and it's three key ideological mistakes black people make when it comes to electoral politicians mistake number one you don't get into politics to get you go into politics to protect why is every supreme court justice a millionaire why is nearly every senator a millionaire why has every president in american history been a millionaire at least in modern times because you get into politics to protect the wealth that you have black people want to spend their money on sneakers and jeans and clothes vacations and mercedes and hair and tims and then they want to go to the government and say give me what i need to do better but you just waste it right you understand 2 billion on ed jordan's last year 20 billion on hair care all right four billion on liquor you understand so number one we gotta stop looking at politics as a means of improving economically you get into politics to protect the wealth that we have that's number one number two we have to get out of this mindset nick that says i have to like you in order to vote for you you're a businessman i'm sure you've done business with people you don't like facts but it was mutually beneficial right right so you do it that's how we need to approach politics you don't exclude the republican because he's a republican right and you don't automatically endorse the democrat because he's a democrat you listen to them both and you choose the one who has an agenda that is closely aligned to the one you're trying to push but what if they're only pushing personality what if i that's the problem nick right personality means i got to like you right right do you understand so obama got elected by black folks because we like them because we like them i don't need to like you to do business with you if i got to strike a deal with donald trump for black empowerment i'll strike a deal with donald trump because what i'm not looking for is a black president or a black governor or a black mayor i'm looking for black power stop confusing the personality with the power right well what about but what if it almost goes down to understanding policy because again we vote on we vote on personnel that's what's presented to us most of the time the policies are never presented to us because even a lot of times you can even see donald trump didn't even know half of the policies but he knew how to cater to his his market therefore and the the lobbyists and all those people who actually write the policy i was like oh we can use him he can be that front runner to get these policies pushed through the presidency is a popularity contest facts black or white yeah we know that however people with high political iq can put the emotionalism to the side right and still objectively evaluate this potential candidate on the criteria right it's like going to church and you love the pastor you love his sermon but when that's over you still have a high enough political iq where you could say okay okay pastor i love what you said right but you are bringing in a hundred thousand dollars a month in this church what are we doing for the community around it right do you realize that in eight years in eight years barack obama was never questioned by black people a single time right as to what he would do to not change or solve but just improve right our condition on any of the five major factors which are what miseducation mass incarceration gentrification police genocide and access to wealth miseducation mass incarceration gentrification police genocide access to wealth obama didn't touch not one of them nor did we ask him to in fact he's the first president in american history who black people let do whatever they want in office without no consequences of criticisms he made history wow man and he used al sharpton to make any black person who had a question for obama to feel bad about asking that question so people say dr umar how can you evaluate obama as hard as you evaluate uh clinton or bush because they are all employees of the american white power structure right obama is an employee he doesn't represent the black community he's an employee right and because he's an employee of their system not mine i can evaluate him on the same lines as anyone else because i don't have a low political iq if i have a low political iq i say i can't question obama because he's black and that's how the negro aristocracy has survived so long exploiting black folks because they make you feel bad about asking questions questions wow that's deep so then what about that concept of are they saying whether it's obama clinton bush trump the hood always going to be the same i mean i remember i was out doing surrogate work trying to encourage people to vote and a brother literally came up to me and told me he was too broke to vote and and he knew it was going nothing was going to change and his truth to that yeah yeah and that's true and to that concept as we know the presidency is a popularity contest and you know we understand the importance of local government yes but in this situation like the average black man's life isn't going to change directly in in his mindset based off whoever the president because politics is not the central driving force of black liberation let me say it again politics cannot be the central driving force of black liberation it is a supportive strategy nick a part of that major black agenda it is not the black agenda but the naacp the urban league the congressional black caucus our black sororities and fraternities our graduates organizations the black church the negro aristocracy have made black people think that you can change everything if you elect the right person nobody else believes in that garbage and the reason why it's so easy to convince black people to believe that even negroes with a high political iq is because at the end of the day nick deep down inside of us we don't want the responsibility that comes with true liberation do you know what that would mean that would mean 25 percent of your take-home pay got to go into the black liberation fund you understand me yeah and then there will be people at your door to the collection do you understand me that means let's say you have uh 200 disposable hours in your work week right 50 of them is volunteering for the liberation structure right do you see what i'm saying you have this amount of money in your retirement well guess what we need 25 percent of that for this black hospital this black bank that we black folks don't want no accountability for liberation see voting is easy one time go home feel good about your vote church pray one time and go home but a true liberation movement requires sacrifice and accountability and we don't want to do both right i don't want to do anything for you and i damn sure i want you holding me accountable for what i didn't do right so the reason why politics is so important to black people is because we don't have any other strategies in play right right so based off but we are a lone ranger community we will vote or literally die because we ain't gonna do nothing else is that the lack of leadership it is the lack of leadership but i'm not going to put that totally on leadership that's half of it the other half of it in order for the leader to be effective dr king the most honorable markets messiah garvey malcolm x going all the way back all the way forward the people got to be ready for the leader to lead if dr king was with us today i don't know if he could do what he did 50 years ago because we ain't there right now right we all into this we're comfortable we comfortable i got a cell phone i got a laptop i got food on there i got food i got tim's on i got a bank card yeah and you know what's sad about that we have equated the trinkets of american civilization with freedom and the reason black people can equate the trinkets of american civilization with freedom nick is because we never experienced real freedom see if you had a real cheese steak a real philadelphia cheese if somebody bring you a cheese they can say this is a philly cheesesteak you know this ain't a philly cheesesteak cause you had one before right but if you've never tasted a philly cheesesteak somebody could sell you a fake one and you think it's the real one yeah that's how freedom is with black folks we've never had freedom nick in 400 years so when somebody comes and say having a cell phone and a phd in a house in a white suburb is freedom we believe it because we've never had true freedom wow that's why it's so easy to brainwash us so yes the leaders have been weak but the people have been even weaker right let's be honest not every black preacher is a pimp right but for those who are yeah you can't blame them totally for it their followers know they're pimping yeah and they're going there for that moment because what would you rather have if you were politically lazy negro do you want a preacher like dr king that's going to make you go out and face the police after the sermon or do you want a preacher that's gonna tell you just put a couple dollars in the bucket and i'll pray you to heaven and you ain't got to do no dr king protest because god is going to come and solve all this for us who do you really want in that pulpit you want the hustler all right because the hustler don't demand nothing from you right so the reason you can have all these black pimp preachers is because black people don't want to do no real work right you see so you say some of the criticism i get now 99 of our people love me in my work but that one percent that hates part of the hate is dr umar's trying to tell us we got to roll up our sleeves and work our way out of this right but the pastors say i could pray my way out right right the politician the congressional black caucus said i could vote my way out of this thing what this __ we're talking about i gotta stand up to the power structure and give my money and show up at the meetings i don't wanna do that right so what's really going on here is it's not that the misleaders are so effective right the people they're leading are just as disinterested in true freedom as they are yeah do you see nah absolutely but in the aftermath of dr king's assassination united states government reorganized black power they said we're not going through that number you got to realize right the 1960s politically bankrupted america do you realize j edgar hoover the c.i.a they had about 30 different legitimate black groups they had to fight go back to the 60s you had snick core the sit-ins the freedom rise unia nation of islam h rap brown stokely carmichael do you follow me and they was all serious and sincere right it overwhelmed the political structure of america so when they kill king they say we're never letting this happen again right and and then somebody said what can we do about it guess what they said two things you got to do if you want to crush the black power struggle number one you got to crush black men's economic power you got to crush black men's economic power in other words they engineered joblessness on the road to engineering mass incarceration because all of those groups i just named were funded by who independent black businessmen got it so they came into the high schools nick and they took out all the building trade programs the skills that pay the bills they took out the plumbing the carpentry the electric we wasn't all going to college in the 1970s right but we had good jobs and live decent lives because we had to skip kill ladies so they said we're going to go into the hood and instead of telling these black kids to go get you a trade we're going to tell them to go get that uh go get that master's degree yeah you see what i'm saying put them in debt put them in debt no jobs all debt that's what led to the unemployment which made it so easy for us to pick up the dope when the cia dropped it off in 1980 because there was no jobs so that is cia pumping crack and i got two choices i can sell it to feed my family or use it to deal with the fact that i cannot they engineered it so that was one thing engineer economic dysfunction for black males and the other thing we have to make our own leaders you can't let them come you gotta pick and choose right these leaders you understand so after they killed dr king they started grooming their own leaders right and then they said we're gonna put them in politics we're gonna put them in charge of the universities we're gonna put them in city government they still gonna be loyal to us yeah but they will represent an artificial form of forward movement for black folks and we have been under a dictatorship of false counterfeit black bourgeoisie leadership for 50 years wow are you aware that since dr king now dr king wasn't perfect he was not a pan-africanist but he's one of my heroes right because he's the last leader we had to give black people in this country a comprehensive broad-based grassroots struggle for political economic transformation you can't name a negro sin 68 that has given you a real movement with a real agenda with real objectives that was backed by more than just a good speech king was the last one which is why he's uncomfortable to me and what makes him even more unique is he had a doctorate yeah he was born into a privileged black church family right dr king could have been a td jakes or a creflo dollar he didn't have to give his life for black folks but here's a privileged black minister with a doctorate degree who decides even though i can fall back and preach and live comfortably i'ma dedicate my life to my people so what was that plan i mean it was it the was the poor people's movement the poor people's movement got him killed right not vietnam they didn't like him speaking against vietnam right that probably would have gotten killed right but it was the poor people's campaign yeah because dr king was going to take poor white poor black everybody right ahead of dc right and they were going to not come for a day this wasn't no march no one day march you understand they were going to live right live in the nation's capital erect a tent city and nobody was leaving until they had a house and a job you know what that's called economic revolution yeah they killed dr king because he made a shift after malcolm's death and he made a shift from civil rights to economic rights and when he did that that would have upset the power structure in america they had to kill him because there's only two black men who were more popular than the president at the time of their lives frederick douglass my blood relative was more popular than abraham lincoln and dr king was more popular than john f kennedy or lyndon baines johnson and when you have a black leader that is that powerful that he garners more attention and popularity than the president he got to go because what's the first rule in the 48 laws of power robert greene says don't outshine the frederick douglass and dr king outshine the master yeah and uh and i love where you where you take it uh but even just to put it into some context for you know some viewers that may not know the history and aspect of just even when we speak of they and the system um because you even speak of you know it it's a a 50 year old plan a century-year-old plan the idea of even if we want to talk about like you know centralized banking and the understanding of keeping everyone in debt whether it's college to mortgages the credit cards the system of that we are property not just black people but but everybody your birth certificate is is is really currency for this country that's true um that's true that idea of when you speak of they and them in that system the elite infrastructure is that is that all is that based off facts that's based off facts and and how does if that is based off facts how does that continue even to this day with so much information and knowledge that we are still up under that same oppression because the system remains the same the only thing they switch out nick is the content the system remains the same like does donald trump know he's operating that system the president is not an employer the president is an employee remember when barack obama got elected and it was a whole big thing over the fact that they gave him a blueberry and took his cell phone do you remember that yeah yeah if you're the employer don't nobody come and say give me your phone and take this one it seemed like trump still got hit but see the reason donald trump became president it was supposed to be hillary yeah presidents are chosen four to eight years in advance don't nobody vote no president in they never did right america is not a democracy right the word democracy is not in the constitution right the word democracy is not in the preamble the word democracy is not in the articles of confederation the word democracy is not in any of your 50 state constitutions right this is not a democracy it is a republic democracy is rule of the majority right republic is the rule of law and who establishes that law the elite right the white man did not come from britain because he wanted more political freedom the white man came from britain is because he wanted an opportunity to have a dominant dictatorship just like the one you wanted more the same you understand just like the american revolution they didn't fight that for freedom do you know why the 13 colonies opposed britain because britain had already enacted a law to begin the gradual elimination of slavery right the white man in america thomas jefferson and ben franklin george washington said how are you going to outlaw slavery we ain't done using it yet getting money the american revolutionary war this is fact the american revolutionary war was fought because the white man in america needed slavery to continue right and the crown was looking to eliminate it right it had nothing to do with freedom it was about keeping us in bondage but again they switch out the content nick but the system remains the same right you see you saw the situation that happened with the nfl the other day uh the browns versus uh the steelers yeah yeah and at the end the brother hit the white quarterback over here with the helmet he was wrong all right and he may even need a punishment for that right yeah but to be suspended indefinitely if that's the punishment i got an issue with that because i've seen white football players do worse two black football players on the field i remember i saw bill romanowski of the denver broncos spit in the face of another football player and got like a one-game suspension i'm not saying he don't get punished but let's go back and look at the film because i've seen black athletes get called the n-word by opposing teammates right why wasn't that an indefinite suspension right you see everybody knows the reason why it's indefinite is because the attacker was black and the victim was white but nobody's dealing with the fact that that white quarterback kicked him into growing nobody's dealing with the fact that he tried to take his health first do you understand but and i asked everybody the question if the quarterback was black and he was hit over the head by a star white defensive lineman would he have been suspended indefinitely we all know the answer is no all right there's a double standard in america and part of problem i have nick is i'm getting tired of black male celebrities volunteering to assassinate black masculinity by defending the things that white people do to black folks i'll give you a couple of quick examples not to put nobody on the spot but i'm doing it out there and i ain't got no issue with these brothers by the way i'm just showing you an example of dysfunctional behavior yeah i was watching skipping skipping shannon yeah yeah lil wayne was on there a couple years ago yeah this is right around the colin kaepernick situation yeah and skip asks lil wayne the question to the effect of what is your opinion on what's going on with the colin kaepernick piece police genocide race relations in america right and little wayne and i'm paraphrasing i don't want to get the brother's words wrong but he said to the effect that i'm the wrong person to ask right because i've never had to deal with that i had to replay that i said did a black man just say on national tv right that he don't have an opinion on racism because he never experienced any you are from what the seventh eighth ward of new orleans from the hood the hood right and on top of that chocolate brother right okay barack obama is the most privileged black man in american history even he's dealt with racism right he's the most privileged black man in american history even he's dealt with racism how can little wayne get on national television and say i'm not the person that asks about racism i think if defensive wayne wayne is on another planet though like i don't care what planet you are clearly has dealt with i mean he went to prison in new york for gun charges and the gun wasn't even why say i'm not the one to ask i'm not throwing him under the bus but i'm saying this is an example of an influential black personality a black male but it goes back to what you were saying of we're scared to not only uh ask questions but answer questions in that idea to me that is a self-inflicted assault on our own black masculinity we almost don't want to have an opinion because we know we don't have to deal with the consequences absolutely and that means that's anti-masculinity don't you yeah yeah because part of being a masculine part of being a man is being courageous and assertive because that's why i thought you were going with it even with a lot of the celebrities and even i get flack for being so outspoken and and standing firm on masculinity and yes and the way i father and the things because now if you say something about protecting your daughter or if you say something about uh being assertive uh to whether it's your own children or in the workplace then they want to they want to attack you they want to they want to bring you be willing to accept that because had it not been for black people who came before us to accept those types of attacks for being unapologetically african we would not even be here there's no examples of that today it's and that in that in that field i'll follow you but even if you don't have those examples in your everyday life they're in our history yeah everyone knows what nat turner did everyone knows what harriet tubman did everyone knows what martin delaney i'm busy chasing the bag that's true but that does not justify or excuse your behavior yeah i give you one more and then i want to give you one where i felt the brother did a good job okay stephen a smith this was year before last villanova had just won the national basketball championship yeah the white boy from villanova i believe he was an italian he's an nba now he won mvp right it came out later that he was using the n-word i don't know if he was a rapper or he was in the conversation he used the n-word right and so it made national news right stephen a smith volunteered to be his defense attorney to the black media and started talking about how much he didn't mean to use the n-word it was taken out of context and hip-hop that word is used and i'm watching a black man on national tv defend a white man's right to use the n-word without even being asked to do so i give you another one when eminem when some of eminem's old lyrics was discovered remember that and he was calling black girls dumb and ugly or whatever rapper after rapper without even being asked by eminem to defend him rushed to the radio and started defending a white man's right to use the most horrific the most gruesome and the most grotesque word ever used to defend black folks that is anti-masculine behavior you don't ever go on the defense of your oppressor against your own people and then here's a positive example t.i yeah he had what's what's that guy the uh he deals in that alien stuff michael uh uh on the show he had the guy what's his name uh ali uh trying to think what are you talking about he deal with the aliens and the people from mars and the reptilian agenda one of those anyway the guy was going in on candace owens oh right right t.i had just did a thing with the platform with candace they disagreed yeah yeah what i loved about what t.i did though nick is he he was trying to coach t.i to throw candace under the bus because they disagreed right right but t.i exercised black masculinity and told him that even though i disagreed she's still my sister right and i support her right he killed it right there right right he didn't have to attack the white male or anything he just let it be known that even if she and i disagree she's my sister and i support her all i'm saying is we have to do a better job as black men of defending the respect of our community because i'm getting sick and tired of us volunteering to protect the status quo so then that brings up a good conversation uh too and i think we we touched on it here and there throughout throughout the this session is there tends to be especially in the conscious community you have highly educated uh full of wisdom and knowledge individuals but for some reason we tend to use this information uh to almost be boastful and and as a competition uh and we find ourselves that you know i have this belief i'm a pan-africanism believer i'm i'm a i'm a believer and whatever your your religious or political beliefs are and then we find ourselves using our platforms to challenge yes disgracing each other based on in public in other words here we go again so you got the brothers gang banging on the street right right now we go into black consciousness right right all you did was switch out the what the identity and the ideology right right yeah so instead of __ blood is now pan-africanist socialists yeah nation of islam guys on earth yeah nawapi in hebrew and i'm not saying they're gangbanging i'm just using them you know samples right doing it in public and we're doing it in the things where at a time like this in social media when martin and malcolm be going at each other absolutely on instagram well well martin and malcolm wouldn't go at each other because martin and malcolm were both sincerely committed to the struggle one one caveat i would add to what you're saying because i totally agree with you it is wrong and it's anti-progressive but let us be clear about something my brother nick cannon most of the personalities that you see in the black conscious movement very few of them are sincerely committed to the struggle there's very few dr cars you understand dr umar johns this few many of them are hustlers and because black consciousness is now a new hype thing right they're hustling the consciousness it's no different than when spike lee came out with malcolm x movie in the 90s and everybody went out and got a mock-up malcolm x hoodie malcolm xt where is that now in the 1960s everybody got the black leather they red black and green they afro where is that now i'm telling you that black consciousness is being exploited by opportunists in the streets for financial gain right and if you say that's a pretty strong charge the levy against these brothers and sisters right right and there are exceptions i could prove it real simple okay do a survey of all of and ask them two questions two things what are those two questions what are you currently changing to make things better for african people and what are you building to make things better than african people either you are building an institution to serve us or you are actively engaging in the changing of some narrative right or system so that we can more accurately prepare for our future it's either one or the other if all you do is sit on youtube and make videos do you follow what i'm saying right or have cultural events and festivals but you're not building no institution or changing no institution then you are an opportunist right it's as simple as that you must be building or you must be changing wow it cannot just be i'm a youtube chief teacher right so i mean i think that even gives you uh an opportunity to to talk about the things that you're doing i mean asking yourself those two questions and sharing i mean obviously and i'll start with the building yeah yeah uh february of this year we purchased a four building campus in wilmington delaware uh for the frederick douglass and marcus garvey leadership academy which will be america's first school for black boys based exclusively off of revolutionary pan-african nationalism and international economics i am getting away from the narrative that the primary purpose of public school nick is to prepare kids to get accepted into college right because as we said earlier college is putting us into debt right you have over two million african americans in this country right now with master's and doctorate degrees not bachelor i'm not talking associates i'm talking masters and doctorates who cannot find work so the narrative that in elementary or middle high school exists so i could go to school is counterproductive because school ain't guaranteeing black folks no employment you know how many resumes i got on my laptop from black folks emailing me talking about i'm looking for a job engineers lawyers can't get paid wow because they economically devastated us back in the 70s and 80s by stripping the skills out to school to put you into debt so we're changing that narrative at fdmg okay we're going back to the book of t what is the answer back to vocational concepts that's a part of it right see when you talk about nation building you got to have a little bit you got to have all of it i'm not saying don't send no black kids to college because there's certain professions that require college training right engineer doctor psychologist if you ain't going to college you can't be right so i'm not saying not to send some but to send everybody mike mike ray ray and john john he barely got out of high school he wanted to go to howard do you understand me do you if you barely got out of high school i do your family you won't be going exactly but parents are doing it because they believe in order for them to look successful their children got to go to college so they would rather go into debt to save face with other negroes and make the best decision for their child wow so with the frederick douglass marcus garvey academy i want all your listeners to know that if they want to support our work they can donate and they can send a check of money order payable to the fdmg academy to po box 9634 wilmington delaware i repeat fdmg academy po box 96 34 wilmington delaware or you could donate on the cash app by going to cash dot me slash dollar sign fdmg school i repeat the arm on the cash app is dollar sign fdmg school my ancestor frederick douglass once said that it is better to raise strong children than to repair broken men so when you say where do we start to fix this nick yeah part of where you start is with the children i think that we do not allocate black community resources effectively we spend 85 percent of our attention trying to fix grown folks right in the meantime the children are becoming more dysfunctional because they're not getting the attention i'm not saying give up on the adults i'm not saying give up on ray ray and taytay yeah what i'm saying is most of your attention should go on the child not the adult because as a psychologist right by the time you five your personality is long yeah by the time you're 15 you ain't likely to change by the time you're 25 you can forget it and 35 whoever you are you're gonna die that way so why are we trying to change people whose personalities are largely fixed right when you have babies who have not yet formed their personality so it's more about the cradle to prison pipeline than the school of prisons you get them before they get it oh absolutely before they get this question absolutely because that's that's what you're gonna build what type of person they're gonna be in the other movement so that's what i'm building right because i'm doing both i'm garvey so we action so that's the school right and if anybody wants to work at the school they can send me their resume fdmg resumes gmail.com and here employing us without question and we're looking for people who got unique skills nick that can benefit our children what do i mean by that you might not be a licensed teacher but you might be a farmer we can use that you might not be a licensed teacher but you might uh be into uh animals right we can use that you understand you might know how to make clothing we can use that you might know how to build websites we can use that we want our boys to graduate nick being able to earn skills and over 20 different skills right even if they never go to college right we will have an economic science curriculum they would be taught real estate international investments stock market they would be investing in penny stock third grade wow we're not playing games we're not playing games because for our women to respect us again let's understand something the contempt that the black woman has for the black man nick to some extent is it is justified it's justified why is that because when she look at other women she see that their men can do things for them that we can't do for them don't get me wrong that's not all i thought we didn't ask to be here none of the institutions that oppress black men are ruled by black men we don't rule the prison system we don't rule the school system we don't rule the economic system so it's not all our fault right but i understand what a sister is coming from and if we want to change the way our women value us then we're going to have to economically empower ourselves so they can come to us with our needs and we can say sister i got you right we got to be able to walk into these department stores and fast food restaurants where we see black women being disrespected daily right by anglo-saxons to arabs and say sister you don't need this come on i got a job for you and not only take her to the job but not try to get any shooky nookie on the way to the job do you understand that that's right so we can fix let me give you this point you know why nobody really feels sorry for black america despite everything we go through the trayvons and the sandra blands and the jail in the schools we're the only african population on the planet nick on the planet that can solve their problems themselves no other african population can solve their problems themselves with the exception of maybe canada or the united kingdom right but most african communities are dependent to some degree on the government for intervention not us we are two trillion dollar people not us what's going to happen next friday what's going to happen next friday in america it's black friday yeah and guess what negro's going to do in philadelphia we're going to spend 3 billion listen to this i didn't say million i said billion in philadelphia pennsylvania the fifth or sixth largest city in america we're going to spend three billion dollars on christmas can i ask you a question yeah if philadelphia has a population of 1.5 million half of that is black so we about 750 000 right and if we're going to spend 3 billion in philly being a population of 750 000 could you imagine what the new york city black christmas bill was going to be can you imagine what the chicago black christmas can you imagine la and houston right here and do you understand me so how are you going to cry about not having good schools poor healthcare no jobs no banks no supermarkets no factories when you're wasting billions of dollars on garbage man we got it do you see so you can take the slave out of slavery all day long but until the slave takes the slavery out of himself he will never be free it must be a psychological revolution nick before any other revolution if you don't change the way we think about ourselves our future and our oppressor nothing changes the mind is the first place to make the change what did dr carter g woodson say in miseducation of the negro he said if you control a man thinking you don't have to worry about his actions if you bring him to the house you don't even have to tell him to go to the back he'll go on his own and when he gets to the back if there is no door he will make the door and walk out of it that is how dr woodson also said it took him 20 years to undo the mental side that harvard university put inside of him the most honorable marcus garvey said don't take the kinks out of your hair take the kinks out of your mind so i'm saying we have to have a psychological revolution before we have an economic revolution spiritual revolution political revolution social revolution change the african mind tear it down and build it up and that's what we're going to do at fdmg man well you unpacked a lot and it's just the beginning man uh it's an honor to sit with you and build with you on this level definitely got to do it again but i i'm i'm inspired uh i'm driven and i know uh a lot of the people listening and watching are definitely gonna do the same so much continued success thank you brother thank you man dr umar johnson it's a revolution 
"water when unmanipulated is to find its level so whether you look at a cup of water a bathtub a swimming pool a lake or the ocean its flat of course natural motion is not considered and doesn't equal a curve we have zero authentic pictures of the earth and they're all composites and NASA even admits that they Photoshop Earth images it is photoshopped but it's it's has to be on numerous occasions NASA admits that we can't go beyond low-earth orbit which is between 99 miles and 1,200 miles away the interesting thing is that the moon is set to be two hundred and thirty eight thousand miles away which is a difference of two hundred and thirty six thousand eight hundred miles no matter if you're on the ground on top of a building a mountain a hot air balloon an airplane or looking at high-altitude amateur balloon footage the horizon never fails to rise right to your eyes whether you are looking at Toronto's skyline from niagara-on-the-lake 31 miles away Chicago's skyline from Union Pier 43 miles away or even Oahu from kawaii which is up to a hundred and eight miles away from Center to Center or 73 miles away from the closest points you will not see any curvature where it's supposed to be according to the Pythagorean theorem which states that the curvature of the earth is eight inches per mile squared oh ah who should not be visible whatsoever but you can see the whole thing in 1887 Albert Michelson and Edward Morley conducted what's known as the Michelson Morley experiment this experiment was attempting to proof the speculated motion of the earth around the Sun and when it failed Albert Einstein was forced to form the theory of relativity to overcome this problem in fact any time mainstream science is faced with undesirable results they create a workaround which isn't real science at all the Sun is claimed to be 93 million miles away with a radius of over 400,000 miles but can easily be proven to be much closer and smaller by tracing the crepuscular rays back to its origin in the sky if the Sun were indeed 93 million miles away it would simply be impossible to have angled sun rays as they should all consistently come in straight according to the globular Theory a lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun Earth and Moon are in a direct line but it is on record that since about the 15th century over 50 eclipses have occurred while both the Sun and Moon are visible above the horizon FH cook the terrestrial plane it's a common misconception that the shadow of the earth causes moon phases even the pastors and priests of the science religion readily admit this fact the interesting thing about moon phases is that they are always the exact same eight phases repeated but if we were circling around the Sun these eight phases would inevitably be reversed from the summer to winter seasons I completely understand that the idea of a flattened stationary earth seems ridiculous in many ways but that's only because we are taught the false globe model from the very first time that we enter a school classroom not to mention the first time we are introduced to the concept of a Flat Earth it's depicted as a highly laughable world where ships boats and water would run off of the edge so I do get it but it's all part of the deception I've spent 30 years of my life believing that we were on a spinning globe it wasn't until I unbiased ly and scientifically investigated the Flat Earth claims that I started to realize that there is more to this theory than I originally gave it credit for now after almost two years of research I'm certain that the earth is flat we are told that the earth spins at 1040 miles per hour while the earth travels around the Sun at 66,000 miles per hour meanwhile the whole solar system is going inside the Milky Way galaxy at a speed of four hundred and ninety thousand miles per hour and finally the entire Milky Way galaxy is starting through infinite space at over 1 million miles per hour most people believe this and yet every experiment ever conducted to prove even the simple spin of the earth has failed the same thing goes for curvature it's never been proven and the only time we see it is in movies NASA's CGI or when we're looking through a distorted fisheye lens with all that said please continue to research critically and don't be afraid to ask reasonable questions and speak out you."
Applause foreign Applause this is the paul mcguire report i'm paul mcguire america is in chaos and you see that on the various mainstream media news channels specifically the cable news channels other channels video audio social media and the internet at the same time that we see chaos in america we see trends movements indicators of uh positive outcomes for a lack of a better term things that will implement positive change some change is good some changes evil or awful it depends what is within the category of change and we always have to remember that america is a completely unique nation it's different than the rest of the world not just because i say so or somebody else says so because it is it's a factual statement to say that america is unique among the other nations of the earth thus the term american exceptional america is the only nation on planet earth which is governed by legal documents that were produced from biblical thought or a biblical worldview because our founding fathers like thomas jefferson abraham lincoln george washington or whoever whether or not they were quote evangelical christians whether or not they were like pilgrim or puritan type christians or whether or not they were some strange hybrid theology somewhere between the bible and freemasonry they say that's impossible and you may well be right it may well be impossible to synthesize those two opposite theological belief systems because one is occultic one is biblical but in any case because of the superior excellence of the biblical pilgrimage educational institutions in the 1600s and 1700s all of our founding fathers were exposed to intelligent intellectual historical philosophical theological they were exposed to biblical thinking rigorously and a biblical worldview why because the pilgrim and uh puritan educational establishments were so superior to any of the others on every level not just the spiritual level the historical mathematical level as well they were so superior that even if a founding father was a person who embraced freemasonry or masonry or whatever they were still inundated with biblical thought and it showed up in the decisions and the unique legal or documents we have for america called the bill of rights and the constitution final mind is that no other nation has a bill of rights and a constitution that provides anywhere near as much freedom as ours does period and that's what makes america america american exceptionalism because it is every other nation begins with a quasi tyranny even if it's a soft tyranny even if it's a subtle tyranny it's a quasi tyranny because it does not embrace the truth that our founding fathers said should be self-evident that it is the creator capital c that has given us certain inalienable rights that means rights that are given to a people by god since they're given to a people by god they can't be taken away by a finite government that the creator capital c has given us certain inalienable rights such as life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that produces freedom of religion freedom of the speech freedom of press and many other freedoms which allows america to be the only nation on planet earth that has what's called the american dream think about this for a moment this certainly is never talked about in the marxist socialist educational systems that dominate america and that is the truth that america is uniquely free because of its biblical worldview it's never even acknowledged by the marxist professors who who have infected our educational system with a virus far worse an ideological virus far worse far more deadly than the coronavirus because it it produces a death sentence for people at a higher percentage rate ultimately than the coronavirus does so what's happening in america now today as you're listening what's happening in america today is impacting and affecting the entire planet earth in endless endless ways because we set the tone we set the model for freedom or or loss of freedom right now as i've said countless times and i've titled the title of my book the greatest battle for the hearts and minds of mankind in history of the world that's where we are now and in a very short period of time america will have chosen a pathway that either guarantees the preservation of your liberties of your freedoms of the right to buy and own your own house to pursue an american dream america will either have embarked on that pathway he says no uh there's no middle ground or america will have embarked on the pathway of totalitarianism bring up big big brother an orwellian totalitarian regime a dictatorship it's one road or the other and anybody who does not acknowledge the fact that there are at least two fundamentally basic different roads that produce two basic fundamentally different futures is either chronically stupid on the area you're so stupid you should be arrested it should be a crime that's how stupid you are criminal criminality is stupid or you should be arrested for your stupidity either you fit into that category and that's why you can't grasp what's going on or you fit into the category of you know nothing about history and the historical precedent because every single nation on the face of the earth that has embarked down the path of socialism marxism has always ended up in a unfree totalitarian state with poverty with no social justice with all your freedom stripped and stolen from you by a big brother government there's no deviation as we know and there's no exception to this rule absolutely none it's a hundred percent death rate for nations that embrace communism socialism yet in the light of that you have these uh pitter-patter airhead christians who who live in some who float above the ground as they walk they're so spiritual they're so ignorant of the fact that the fundamental characteristics of a marxist atheist socialist society fundamental characteristic is that buried beneath all the rhetoric on social justice and redistributing wealth and oh how much we love you and buried beneath all of that stuff is the historical reality that people who embrace this communist marxist socialist state always end up living in a tyranny they never get their social justice their wealth redistribution their freedoms are taken away and they become uh prisoners in a concentration camp type of society that's the historical record that's why since communism um has invaded numerous nations with its deception various communist revolutions that have occurred over the last 135 years or so have produced a total death rate of around it's always secretive 240 million people have died through starvation execution shot to death concentration camp re-education camp um or they send the people in communist societies who don't adhere to communism into mental hospitals where they have wrought and died this is this is reality so not to know reality and not to know history really is a crime especially in light of the fact that the people who are going to suffer are the children and the grandchildren and the little children and the children becoming into young adults and adults etc in fact every age category of men suffered brutally under no exception no deviation to that rule and right now america is voting whether or not literally to send us into a communist socialist future or let's call it a capitalist christian future which way which way will america choose yeah america has been dumbed down you know that but america willingly signed up to be dumped down especially in the church they were the first line and now as anything god's law of sowing and reaping which is phrased by many kind of slang expressions like the chickens come home to roost is kind of another way of saying uh the law of sowing whatever you sow so should you reap you start promoting and spreading the doctrine of communism like seeds and soil which is the hearts and minds of little boys and little girls you're going to have a harvest of wickedness a harvest of evil it's inevitable that's what you sowed you sowed wickedness what kind of harvest did you expect in the same way jesus christ tells us that uh whatever we sow so shall we also reap but jesus christ also tells us to go into all the world and preach the gospel evangelize the loss what is that you're planting the seeds of the word of god soil which is the hearts and minds of mankind in order to reap a soul harvest which means to win souls for jesus christ to evangelize the loss that's the purpose of paul mcguire ministries and paradise mountain church is to evangelize the loss and jesus tells us regarding our time period that the harvest fields are white for harvest but the laborers the amount of people willing to go out and bring in and and plant the seeds for the souls to be saved and then to bring in spiritual harvest through evangelism the laborers jesus said are few that's characteristic of our time but this ministry paul mcguire ministries paradise mountain church along with you who are partners with us you're committed i'm committed to not only saving souls but to bring in the last day of soul harvest jesus said fields are white for harvest but the laborers are few why are the fields of white for harvest because we're in the last days the prophetic signs are being fulfilled and god it's god's prophetic destiny for america and other nations and regions of the world it's god's prophetic destiny for america to act as a great vehicle of god for a great last days soul harvest which we can go out and reap because the harvest is is what white feels her wife for harvest people are at such a place emotionally and spiritually that there are countless millions of people ready to uh receive christ into their lives in fact the most powerful thing that we can do to change a family a people a nation a community one of the most powerful things you can do to change any of these things for the better is to effectively preach the gospel of jesus christ to effectively win souls to to effectively bring in the fields that are white for harvest yes spiritual warfare is essential yes being informed and active is essential yes but along with that other things that we should be doing is preaching the gospel and winning the laws making disciples of all nations and occupying the land will become this is there's nothing that is as powerful as that in terms of transforming a nation we complain about the evil and the evils and the wickedness in america one can understand why but the evils in wickedness in america there is a cure there is an antidote and the antidote is the aggressive preaching effectively of the gospel of jesus christ in order to win souls that will transform any people group any nation radically and so that is what paul mcguire ministries in paradise mountain church that's our number one goal and that's why i ask you on a regular basis to be intercessory prayer partners with us praying for me my family in this ministry that's why i ask you to spread the links of our programs our social media our internet media to spread them far and wide to under ordinary uh circumstances get what we use and that's why i ask you to go before the board seek to take the lord and simply ask the lord how much would you have need to give financially in terms of contributions or donations paul mcguire ministries paradise mountain church and whatever the lord tells you to do you obey him because that is how we are able to fund and support and activate the preaching of the gospel of jesus christ the making disciples of all nations teaching of the word of god and on numerous platforms as you know right now we're expanding our platforms we're uh adopting multiple new platforms as a edge against censorship and that's why you need to write down or put yourself on or how whatever you do to remember paul mcguire ministries at fridayon.com bradyon.com and our main portal is paul mcguire us and we're going to be adding to you other social media platforms because there's a war against the truth on the internet i was watching it today a number of biggest of the biggest tech giants you know arrogant uh thinking that they can act like uh self-serving gods and just deciding that they're going to censorship this or that these people don't believe in free speech they believe in what whatever they say goes whatever their perspective is is the right perspective that's a totalitarian approach there's no respect for the beliefs of others whether you agree with it or not america is great or has been great because it has been a champion of freedom of speech that means everybody whether you agree with them or not has an opportunity to communicate with their speech or technology or whatever openly now that's changed in america because freedom is under assault why is freedom under assault because secretly behind the scenes the globalist elite along with the trillions of dollars they have to spend are re-molding america reshaping america to be a globalist little unit inside of a globalist control dominated one world government one religion one world economic system the new world order predicted in genesis 11 when god judged ancient babylon at the time of the power of babel divided it from being a one-world government into many independent uh nation-states all of this is happening now it's like a whirlwind and there are powerful interests that are totalitarian like the way they control the masses your children my children grandchildren other people's children adults the way they control the masses is through mass mind control which occurs primarily through the internet through social media through television through episodic tv through movies through films through music through uh lyrics so-called scientist speaking but only certain kinds of scientists scientists like all the other groups i just mentioned have to be carefully pre-screened their so-called scientific beliefs or their so-called beliefs as entertainers must adhere to must inform to whatever the big brother orwellian view dictates or demands at the present moment so there's no freedom of speech there's only freedom of big brother type speech that's where we are and see where this leads that's where we are but where it leads is to the place where they tear down all platforms that preach biblical christianity or preach conservative ideas based on the bible or whatever all of those platforms and individuals using those platforms will be shut down and silenced because a dictatorship does not tolerate it it talks infinitely about the need for being tolerant it talks infinitely about the need to respect diversity but in practice it it rules dictatorially on an infinite basis brushing out all freedoms all freedom of speech all all diversity uh is tolerant of nothing it's the it's the ultimate paradox the free speech movement which began in the late 1960s when i was a little kid i i supported the belief systems of the free speech movement which occurred at the university of berkeley and the free speech movement basically was a national movement adopted by the hippies and the radicals which i was part of which said that you have the right to say anything you want to say you have the right to believe anything you want to believe that's what free speech is but when the people who who adopted this idea of free speech in their free speech movement they didn't calculate the wrong turn that the entire radical liberal movement would make over the next decades they didn't they didn't calculate where the free speech movement would ultimately end up and that is it ends up in a place where you have no free speech where a word has to be evaluated on whether or not it's politically correct and if a word or a term is not politically correct then it is censored it's deleted and there's mass surveillance technology along with artificial intelligence etc etc which is constantly scanning the internet scanning websites scanning emails scanning every part of your life in order to determine whether you're adhering to the big brother totalitarian directives or not there's that's where we are and this place where we are is a new world order america which is completely different than the original america which was america now the real game plan for this new world order america is to shove america into this globalist finance one world government one world religion one world economic system or what is known as the new world order and the new world order will prop up and continue to enrich the super elite super wealthy and it will continue to destroy the lifestyle the income uh of the working class and the middle class under the guise of saving the planet via climate change or whatever the latest bruises whatever the latest con game is now god's given us this time in history right now this time because this is the time that once you walk through the door you can't get back in when you walk through the door when you walk through the door into the wrong future unfortunately the door self locks you can't get back in because if you walk through the door of the wrong new future you're not allowed to go back and to retrieve beliefs that they've carefully filtered out you are in a giant sensor machine a censorship machine that cannot be undone you need to think about that because that's where we are right now and the future that we walk through will determine future of our children and grandchildren god is sovereign the lord of the bible is sovereign jesus christ as king of kings and lord of lords his prophetic word will come true within the time period of god's prophetic word coming true there's going to be a variation of the level of persecution the level of martyrdom the level of loss of freedoms there will be a variation in the intensity of that as you go from neighborhood to neighborhood state to state geographic area the geographic area nation to nation and nations where the collective tone spiritually of the people for example in america where people are fervently biblical for people are committed to the bible old testament testament where people are committed to evangelism those areas uh will go in a better direction than those states and communities that are built on a collective worldview of socialism or marxism or communism why people shared this before ideas produce consequences good ideas produce good consequences and bad ideas produce bad consequences so it's important that you dedicate i dedicate my life to the communication to the dissemination of good ideas which are our ideas based on biblical ideas and that we do everything we can and everything in our power to spread those good ideas which are god ideas which come from the bible that we do everything we can to spread god's word to other peoples to young people people all over this nation to communities all over the world that's the that's the primary spiritual weapon that can preserve our freedoms so you and i need to obey the word of god where it teaches us to do this and so we need to be committed as most of you are prayerfully i am by god's grace that's why paul mcguire ministries is committed to moving forward to bringing in this last day soul harvest to communicating a biblical worldview and by acquiring technologies that will enable us to avoid the schemes of the evil one that wants to censor and tear us down and with your help your financial partnership your donations your prayers your willingness to spread our message far and wide we can overcome or do an end run around uh censorship machines that are aggressive and use artificial intelligence we can do an end run around we you and i need to brace ourselves whatever the outcome of this election is there is going to be a season of turmoil and chaos and all kinds of weird stuff erupting and we need to pray now like we've ever prayed before and we need to pray ongoing fashion and then we need to pray for our nation after the election no matter who wins because we're going to enter a period of chaos and our prayers are are willing to use the spiritual authority that god has given us our prayers can be used by god to occupy the land until jesus comes because there are behind the scenes forces of evil forces of good for forces of wickedness forces of righteousness because ultimately as we talked about on the paul mcguire report countless times our fight is not with people not with political groups our fight is not against flesh and blood but our fight is against the principalities against powers against the dark unseen forces of wickedness in heavenly places so our primary battle whether it's for us as individuals is spiritual but our primary battle also is spiritual and encompasses nations elections cultures etc etc all of these things and the souls and destiny of millions of people all of these things can be changed or or altered by effective spiritual warfare so i ask you to to join with me in what i call the greatest battle for the hearts and minds of mankind and see the world go to paul mcguire.us and look at our book bundle discounts help us spread the message far and wide and every day it's just not how many minutes or hours you spend it's the fact that you're praying in accordance with god's word coming into the throne room of god boldly because of his grace through the blood of jesus christ and you are choosing to obey god's command upon your life you're choosing to be obedient and to be an intercessory prayer warrior and a spiritual warrior as you fight against invisible powers in the invisible realm spiritual powers of evil and together we're to be one in christ one in the supernatural body of christ fighting these principalities fight is gone we don't have much time what what is what is about to happen is is the tracks are being laid on you know the railroad tracks are being laid down on the ground train's about ready to come very quickly you need to simply ask the lord lord lord jesus i ask you give me wisdom what you want me to do regarding anything wait on the lord until he answers you and then you don't exalt your own imagination your own will your own decisions you don't exalt that above the voice of the lord speaking to you through his word don't do that that's idolatrous you obey the lord who's speaking to you through his word or if he's speaking to you through his spirit it's always in conforming to god's word god will lead you step by step and you'll know exactly what to do and you'll feel good about that decision because that decision is the decision that will bring you freedom know the truth and act on the truth you're set free the goal here the game plan areas is to be resolved in your heart and mind that you are well able to occupy the land spiritually as joshua and caleb said and so you place and you're well able to take the land not because you're such a hot shot or whatever but because your faith is in the supernatural power of god as we exercise that together we're able to occupy the land the devil is going to occupy it we're going to occupy it and that also means occupying the land in the time of an election god bless you this is your brother paul mcfire is it paul mcguire.us that's paul mcguire.us the clock is ticking is it paul mcguire us for all kinds of free resources but remember the clock is ticking you're either praying in a serious serious way or you're awol from spiritual battle i i challenge you to engage in the spiritual battle and to be functional as a spiritual prayer warrior and to obey what god is telling you to do now now is the time you may not have i may not have this opportunity blessed god bless you your brother in christ paul mcguire visit paul mcguire Applause us Applause Applause Laughter Applause so Applause you Applause

"Beyonce taught us that girls run the world, but sadly the queen bee is gravely mistaken. Throughout history power has always been concentrated in the hands of the few- from the first tribal chieftains and their shamans, to today's political elite. But sometimes that power has been held firmly within bloodlines, passed down from generation to generation like a very unearned inheritance. Hello and welcome to another episode of The Infographics Show- today we're taking a look at the most powerful families in the world. 5. Rothschild Family With a name that pops up in nearly every conspiracy theory out there, it's no surprise that the Rothschilds would end up on this list. Whether they are responsible for assassinating JFK to ensure he didn't invade Cuba and thus destroy the lucrative sugar market, to having secretly financed 9/11 on behalf of the aliens from Zeti Reticuli so they could eat our brains- if there's a conspiracy theory out there, chances are the Rothschilds are at the center of it. With a family history such as the Rothschild's though, it's hard to blame conspiracy theorists. Rising from a lowly apprentice working at a small Hamburg bank, Mayer Rothschild displayed from an early age a keen interest and talent for finances. In no time at all Mayer had made himself a prominent member of the global banking industry, and would go on to install his five sons around the financial capitals of Europe. Overseeing operations from London to Berlin, the Rothschilds helped stabilize international currencies through their lending and banking practices with individual governments. While this was generally a good thing as it kept markets stable and people employed, the Rothschilds certainly earned a very pretty penny for their 'charitable' work. As Europe plunged along the industrial revolution, the Rothschilds were there to finance Europe's favorite hobby: waging horrible wars against itself. Mostly staying on the right side of history though, the Rothschilds were quick to lend England about 10 billion in today's dollars to help finance the war effort against Napoleon Bonaparte. By this time the Rothschilds fortune was so vast, and their financial network so elaborate, that they actually received the news of Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo a full day before the British government! Such stunning displays of international power and reach have for long time cast the Rothschilds under extreme suspicion, and they have throughout history been blamed for pretty much every major war or other catastrophe, often portrayed as nothing more than money-hungry and evil to the point of profiteering from human misery. The truth however is that the Rothschilds were simply a family extraordinarily gifted in the world of finance, and their charitable contributions to human society are some of the greatest in history and continue to this day. Or perhaps the Rothschilds paid us to say that so that you won't figure out they are secretly working for the Zeta Reticuli aliens who definitely don't want to eat your brains. 4. Rockefeller Family If there's a name synonymous with the international power and intrigue of the Rothschilds, it's the Rockefellers. John D. Rockefeller was born in rural New York to a father who was a con man and a mother who was deeply religious. Unlike his shuckster father, John was often described as a serious, polite, and honest young man, and at age 17 he began working as a bookkeeper at a small produce firm. Working long hours, Rockefeller delighted in the intricacies of the work, yet had a keen mind for finances and budgeting. Seeing an opportunity with the advent of the internal combustion engine, Rockefeller started a business partnership with a friend and his brothers, going into the business of refining oil at a time when everybody else was busy trying to pump it out of the ground. The discovery of giant oil reserves in Texas, and the growing exploitation of oil in the Middle East made it clear that this new resource was the wave of the future, and yet very little infrastructure existed for the actual refining of oil into fuel and other products. The oil ‘gold rush’ had seen entrepreneurs open up prospecting and drilling companies around the world, but a growing need for oil processing was being unmet. This is where Rockefeller and family came into play. Founding Standard Oil in 1870, Rockefeller's wealth exploded, and he would go on to end up controlling 90 percent of America's oil pipelines and refineries. After his family's monopoly was broken up by anti-trust laws in 1911, the Rockefellers continued to hold on to a large share of the national oil production industry. At the time of this death in 1937, John D. Rockefeller was valued at $340 billion in today's dollars, or four times more than Bill Gates. However in the time since this record high, a rise in international competition and lack of similar talent for finances by Rockefeller's descendants has seen the family wealth plummet down to an estimated $11 billion, though somehow we suspect that they get along just fine with only 11 billion dollars. 3. Morgan Family Born to a banker it's no surprise that John Pierpont Morgan would follow in his father's footsteps and become a banker himself. However, unlike his father, John would go on to found one of the world's most important financial institutions, J.P. Morgan & Company. During a scare in 1893 over the outflow of the US's surplus gold to foreign nations, the US economy looked set to plummet- but in these dire times John saw an opportunity that no others did. Putting together a syndicate of bankers which included the Rothschilds, Morgan used US bonds to buy back gold from foreign investors, thus restoring public faith in the dollar and stabilizing the economy. This gold and bond exchange however allowed Morgan to effectively control the US gold supply, which let him finance the creation of US Steel and General Electric while buying out all competitors- effectively taking over two of the most important financial sectors of the entire nation: steel and electricity. Morgan’s control over the nation’s gold supply at a time when the national economy- and most global economies as well- were tied to the gold standard allowed Morgan to manipulate the economy to raise or lower the value of the dollar and consumer prices. And despite ensuring a measure of fiscal responsibility, this is overwhelmingly why the gold standard is a bad thing- no matter what your belligerently libertarian uncle posts on your facebook wall every other week. Known as an unethical and cutthroat businessman, Morgan bought out, bullied out, or outcompeted any competitors by slashing jobs, reducing wages and generally doing away with anything even remotely related to workplace safety. If it wasn't generating money, it wasn't worth his time- and after all the nation was full of peasants to replace those killed or maimed in horrific industrial accidents. With no minimum wage laws or workplace safety standards, Morgan effectively built an empire built on heaps and heaps of exploitation and human misery- which by the way, is why minimum wage and workplace safety legislation are important things to have. Sometimes government regulations are a good thing to have, though we tend to forget that since we are so far separated from the misery of the industrial revolution and its mass exploitation of the average worker. In modern times not much has changed, with J.P. Morgan widely blamed for helping spread the practices of predatory lending which led to the 2008 global financial crash. Rumors of the Morgan family being war profiteers and generally banking on any human misery that will make them a single penny are popular- and you know what, given the family's past, this time it's clear that if anybody is cooperating with the aliens from Zeta Reticuli to eat your brains it's definitely the Morgans. Yet with such a commanding grip on the global economy, there’s little the individual consumer can do to avoid engaging in a J.P. Morgan-backed business. 2. DuPont Family Sired by a french immigrant who emigrated into the United States in the 1800s, the DuPont family has built an empire based on manufacturing and the distribution of industrial chemicals and military munitions. Initially establishing the family business as a gunpowder manufacturer, DuPont quickly became the largest supplier of gunpowder to the US military, and would go on to begin creating dynamite in industrial proportions. Like so many other monopolies, the DuPont monopoly was broken up in the early 1900s under the Sherman Antitrust Act, but the family still managed to maintain a huge market share of the global munitions industry, having supplied nearly 40 percent of all the munitions used by Allied forces during the First World War. Unlike the Morgan family however, the DuPonts felt at least some obligation to the nation they were profiting from, and so during World War II when the US Government needed help producing plutonium for the war-ending Manhattan Project, the DuPont company designed and built one of the largest plutonium plants in the country, all the while keeping it an absolute secret to prevent the Axis powers from discovering the US's research. In the 1950s after the Soviets exploded their first atomic bomb, the DuPont company once more cooperated with the US government to help America develop the hydrogen bomb, hoping to keep the US's edge over their Soviet competitors. Working hand-in-hand with the US government, DuPont helped focus the efforts of the nation’s scientists, all the while being handsomely compensated by the US government of course. The DuPonts may be the second most powerful family in the world, but are surprisingly the subject of very few wild-eyed conspiracy theories- except for one. Blamed for helping spur the US's prohibition of hemp and cannabis in 1937 in order to protect its paper and nylon manufacturing, the DuPonts have often been the target of those who see overly restrictive anti-marijuana laws as unfair and needless. The widespread use of hemp as a manufacturing product would after all cut into the DuPont’s earnings- yet if marijuana was legalized nationally, there’s little doubt the DuPonts wouldn’t simply immediately engage in the growing and processing of hemp products. And with their vast wealth to back their entrepreneurial efforts, they would be doing so from a commanding lead versus any other competitor. 1. The Bush Family Best known for Presidents George W. Bush and George Bush Senior, the Bush family began its climb to international power with Prescott Sheldon Bush, a US banker and senator. For years the family was accused of hugely profiting from World War II and for having established businesses with corporations that financed Hitler's government, and the reveal of declassified documents in 2003 showed several questionable transactions that could have been in violation of the Trading With The Enemies Act. However after it was revealed in 1943 that a Polish mining interest Prescott Bush was invested in was using forced labor from Auschwitz, Bush distanced himself and engaged in the collection of funds for the victims of the war. The rest of the Bush family hasn't escaped scrutiny though, with both presidents having been blamed for profiting from the wars started under their watch. These allegations may be a bit more of a stretch than those against Prescott Bush however, as it's well known fact that George Bush Sr. was very reluctant about starting a war against Iraq, and it was the consistent prodding from Britain that finally spurred him to action. Whatever the case, having had two members become presidents of the most powerful nation on earth has garnered the family international prestige and connections, making them without a doubt the single most powerful family alive today. Which of these families is truly the most powerful in the world? How delicious exactly are your brains- we have friends from out of town who are curious.

"listen it's shocking it's written about in the book of Revelation could it ever happen the answer is unfortunately yes total population control bill Benny says that's what the National Security Agency wants he should know he was technical director of that agency and worked there for more than 30 years he became one of their top analysts perhaps the best code breaker in America before he resigns because of their domestic spying programs he's with us now from Washington bill thank you so much for being with us we're glad to see you well thanks for having me Pat look how big is this apparatus of the NSA we hear about it but you know firsthand well they're I think they're about 40,000 people working at Fort Meade at NSA headquarters close to 40,000 and then they have facilities all around the world plus a number of contractors also associated when probably on the order of a hundred thousand I would think to two hundred thousand that worked for them directly so it's a rather large operation I mean it's it's between ten and fifteen billion dollars a year that they spend on it ever since 9/11 so that's you know quite a quite a bit of money they're investing in it how much data can they acquire is there any limit to it actually it the only limit is in terms of money power availability and space to add to stack equipment to go and collect the data material well they use it well you've said that the ultimate goal is total population control in a democracy that is really scary business it's actually a totalitarian process that's been used down through history I mean that's what totalitarian dictators States they that's what they want to do they want to know everything about the population so they can control it that was the idea between behind the Soviet Union the East German Stasi that was their idea and the Gestapo and the SS and down through history many others is our stuff more powerful than those agencies you mentioned yeah unfortunately it is that's that's the real the real problem I see is that it's the capacity is when you're looking at electronic activity of individuals like when you use a credit card and when you when you make a phone call or email anybody on the on the internet or or do chatter on the internet that can be monitored in near real-time if that if they're necessary otherwise they can capture it collect it store it and then Brett to actively analyze it so it's something that it provides the opportunity to monitor everybody in the country in fact most everybody in the world in near real-time throughout the day and that's that's really a 1984 on steroids really all right now let's take mrs. Joe average living in Topeka Kansas and she goes to the store and buy something with a credit card NSA's got that right then they they have electronic data they'll collect Financial Act transactions sure she calls her friend Myrtle down the street that phone is monitored that call not all of them but a good many of them are recorded certainly all of the fact that they she made that call is is recorded and stored and and what we call graphed that is building relationships that's one of the real problems here it this is a violation of your First Amendment rights under the Constitution you have the right to assemble free free free assembly which means that it doesn't say you have the right to free assembly as long as the government knows about it which is what's happening when the telecommunications companies turn over all their records of phone calls to and from with duration that tells them everybody you're contacting your whole social network on the phone because it's a simple matter of doing a reverse lookup to see who that is that you're calling oh you quit the agency oh she said what they were doing is unconstitutional could you that is clearly unconstitutional but why does the government on doing it that's the reason I been able to at least from what I can see in public in the public domain is they're doing it for law enforcement worldwide and actually the main users of this data are in fact FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration and other law enforcement agencies in the in the country and they they use this data to find criminal activity and then they go arrest people based on this information and then they have to do a parallel construction which means they use normal policing techniques that they would be expected to use to find evidence that would justify and show probable cause for an arrest then they substitute that for the NSA data in the in the courts in fact that's one of the one of the one of the things that happened in challenging that process was one of the lawsuits was Amnesty International vs. clapper and that made it to the Supreme Court and the only way they got rid of that was to basically lie to the Supreme Court and say that well if anybody had any of this data used against them in the court of law or anything that the defendant they defendants would be told and that was simply a lie nobody has been told to date all right when I when I think of this it's just horrible what do they give this information to the IRS that's the other problem the Drug Enforcement Administration has a special unit the Special Operations Division the sod and that's the that division is supposed to its primary purpose is to look into the NSA data to find criminality and criminal activity the members of that are the CIA the NSA the FBI course DEA DHS and the IRS now that means that the IRS as active action actually has actually Act access to all the data of the social networks of everybody in the country because NSA builds those in the databases that they have from the billing data or they or the contact data that's provided by the telecommunications companies so this in effect allows them if they're they're interested in stopping anybody getting a 501 C 3 application in for tax-exempt status for for say someone in the Tea Party or the Act Occupy group or any religious group attempting to get 501 C 3 or tax-exempt status they would look could look into that mapped graphed relationships and see if you're a part of any organization that they perhaps when a stone wall or slow roll and prevent from becoming politically active and that's what's been going on they've had access to this data and one person was testifying in the the House and Judiciary Committee I believe it was about some of the questions they were being asked by the IRS and one of the questions that was asked that gave me the idea that they were using this information was this one person was asked what what is their relationship with another person there was a specific name well the question I had was not what was their relationship but how did the IRS know about that relationship the only way I could think of that they would know was B through this access to the data at NSA which is where all that information is mapped out so what you're saying is the NSA slips this stuff to them they read it and get a clue getting it and then they go through their normal procedures and act like it they didn't get the information but he got it from another source so they they pull the wool over Congress do you know the congressman yes go ahead and they also use that in court which means in my in my sense that that that means their perjuring themselves in court so I call that a planned program perjury policy run by the Department of Justice of the United States you know I'm horrified in all this and I'm sure the average of America you know most of the congressmen are they come out of neighborhoods and they're elected by the people do you think Congress has even a clue as to what you're talking about probably not not a complete clue but I think that that's part of the reason that representatives a marsh and Conyers got a coalition of members of the house to try to unfund NSA's activity last year they almost made it by about 12 votes they lost 12 by 12 votes but they came pretty close for a first try so there is a move in Congress to to limit and stop this and it really is all of this activities it's unconstitutional into the first Fourth and Fifth Amendment's the first because they're giving you or your associations and everything the government is collecting that data the fourth because they're looking at the content it's not just metadata that they're collecting its content also and and and the fifth because they're using data that you knew that content of data that you pass between your friends and neighbors and and use that against you in a court of law that's a violation of the fifth amendment that is to have you're not you are claim you can claim the Fifth Amendment not to testify against yourself well that's a violation of that too how come some little guy didn't come after you in the middle of the night or have they they have actually they sent the FBI at me in 2007 and tried to intimidate me to stay quiet what about Snowden is he a traitor or hero I looked at him as a as doing a absolute public service not just to the people of this country but to the world because he produced evidence that's irrefutable by our government that's the crimes against the Constitution and the laws that we had over time anyway so that was irrefutable evidence of what they were doing and so they cannot deny it now what kind of megalomaniac would want to do something like this is monstrous and these guys I mean where does the mindset come from that divides us all this stuff well that's what I objected to and why I left NSA early on back in 2001 because I saw this coming I mean I had worked the Soviet Union problem for almost 30 years and and it was very clear to me that in October of 2001 the NSA and government the US government started adopting the procedures and techniques and processes that the Soviet Union and the Stasi and all of the countries behind the Iron Curtain were using so we were we were actually adopting their procedures it was very clear to me that that was what was going on all right last question the average person doesn't have a vestige of knowledge of what you're talking about they just trust their government what are we going to do as citizens well you see let me let me say something about that first that's that's really the problem here in this country you see from my where I see what I see is we have not had a dictator in this country for almost since George the third for almost two hundred and forty years so we've been very comfortable over those two hundred forty years at least kind of depending on our government to do the right thing and that's what we've all been accustomed to them doing that is we trust them and have trusted them for a long time and so we don't have that knowledge of what dictators and dictatorial processes are but if you look at it the Germans today are the ones who are really upset about this and the reason they're upset is because they've got living memory of the Stasi and living memory of the SS and Gestapo so they're very familiar with these techniques and procedures and that's why they're very upset to me I think the only way we can get out of this is to fire everybody in DC that's the only way to do it you have to go out and vote you have to get active you can't stay quiet and let this happen you have to stand up and oppose it Bill Bailey thank you so much you're great to Patriot and keep speaking out and oh well as prayers for your protection because I can't imagine think unless you keep on talking but maybe they don't man well folks if you want to learn more about Bill Binney and the NSA you can go to our website there's more detail about it and you know something is he was talking the Bible makes a statement in the book of Revelation that people could not buy or sell without the mark of the beast and you said okay there is no way that there's any governmental agency that could enforce something like that and what this man who is the technical director the NSA former technical director is saying is that the government now has the technique to do this worldwide you know Google has maps of every if you have a little shack up in the hills someplace Google's got a map of how to get there and that's a private agency and you know your credit cards your telephone calls but the thing is what he's saying is that you pick up the phone and call your girlfriend and that's monitored and that's recorded and it's it's frightening you don't have to be saying you know I'm wondering a lot against the government but it just it's a normal conversation and they call it metadata and all that stuff and we don't understand it enough so we say well oh yeah well we don't have terrorists we don't have blowing up our airplanes well of course we don't but is it the price of safety for a few passengers on an occasional airplane is that worth taking away the liberties of all the people and the answer is no but this is Big Brother it is what is written in the book of Revelation and it finally can happen in our lifetime this is scary stuff shocking really shocking I remember reading 1984 and books like the late great planet Earth and thinking that could never happen in our country people would never buy into that and here we sit well it's like the old business of the Frog and the water you can heat it up slowly and we're more and more accustomed to it and every time it comes out and they say oh it's okay it's the USA PATRIOT Act it was put in by George Bush these are good guys and this is you got a nice general up there three-star general he's got a benign looking face and you figure he's not gonna hurt you and so he's in charge and then somebody else well we also grew up being taught and believing that the check and balance system in our government was going to take care of all this this is huge the the gathering is in the billions and billions and billions of bits and it is we finally have the capacity to control every human being on the face of the earth clean him up that's what he said throw the bums out let's start afresh "
Flat Earth clues part 5 the status quo this is part of a series of clues that can help you get your head around both the design of the Flat Earth system we live in and who has been involved in the deception to hide it from you this clue covers the inevitable and sometimes frustrating question of why the authority would go to all the trouble of hiding the Flat Earth my hope here is to show you different angles and a progression of events all of which lead to a very changed world both physically and mentally to open we have to go way back to when the world was a much more simple place you had your five major religions including Buddhism Hinduism Judaism Islam and Christianity each of these groups had their own version of what is known in Genesis as the firmament or the flat circular world enclosed by a solid dome-like barrier from where the creator or creators looked on i'm not going to explore all the subtle differences between the groups suffice it to say that it's interesting that despite their differences that led to acts of horrible violence between them there was no real earth model debate so around 500 years ago the science community led by Copernicus who probably had a little help introduced what we now know as the heliocentric or globe model of the world which in turn changed the solar system galaxies and so on the religions seem that this globe model was gaining popularity feared a loss in the fan base so they all adapted their religion to include the globe model from their point of view it was a small change from a circular to a globe world and really in a few generations who would remember anyway the churches mosques temples wrapped up their Flat Earth model in a metaphoric soft cloth and put it in the drawer with a good silver for safekeeping remember this because we'll come back to it later and hundreds of years went by with science promoting all the aspects of the globe Mobe and the religions promoting their beliefs upon this globe the world kept spinning so to speak and everyone was happy then in the early part of the 1900s you get this pesky explorer named Richard Byrd he has family money all the right connections and secures basically unlimited funding and the government green light to probe every piece of unseen territory there is it was inevitable I guess a young man who has an unquenchable desire to see all that there is to see and then granting him the tools needed to accomplish this goal he pulls a Truman and gets lucky crossing the vast salt ocean avoiding the icebergs arriving at the frozen coastline and he keeps going he was never going to stop one day after crossing hundreds of miles of high-altitude ice and snow Admiral Byrd sees it a barrier and to him it's just a barrier not the barrier he is but a tiny speck in front of it it stretches out on both sides as far as he can see and straight up so far that he can't discover the beginning of the arc the great Explorer now has a new challenge finding the shape of this thing it's much like a blind man describing in the elephant until you feel out the whole thing what do you really know if you look at the AE or Flat Earth overhead map you see the problem to even determine the scope of the outer wall you have to circle it it would have taken months if not years you could use a series of ships going in opposite directions or planes but there are refueling stations that need be built and so on his task was challenging to say the least Admiral Byrd kept laying the groundwork of the great discovery until his eventual death in 1957 a year later the United States and Russia found the upper edge from there the math was easy and moreover you could actually see the real world then of course there is the decision or deception depending on how you looked at it the authority made the call to hide the actual shape of where we live then sealed off the outer edge from prying eyes and created the space program not only to reinforce the globe model but to control it there was really only one reason they cared about this and it takes a while to process so let's look at the immediate effects of actual disclosure on work our way up to the authorities biggest fear for this exercise will look at releasing the news today instead of say 1958 well 1958 would have been easier it's much more relevant and entertaining to explain it in modern terms we start with a press conference by let's say the United Nations who have discovered that the world is indeed enclosed in a giant hi-tech dome of unknown origin and age the public reacts with Wonder and awe trying to take in the sheer scope of this announcement Facebook crashes Twitter crashes entire mobile networks crash it's like hitting a beehive with a sledgehammer news organizations around the world send teams to the outer edge to confirm the finding and the general public is glued to their media devices that's the good news the excitement the revelation the positive shock then the bad news starts coming in waves some of which you might not expect the first is the immediate disbanding of NASA and all other world space programs for obvious reasons most governments will secretly pardon these groups and keep them immune from class-action lawsuits the lawsuits themselves coming from NASA investment groups claiming fraud regardless everyone at NASA despite their good intentions is out of a job overnight and this is where you would say good they deserve it about time they stop lying to everyone oh but it doesn't stop there because every contractor and subcontractor that are exclusively tied to NASA they have to shut down as well fine a few thousand jobs lost no big deal and the ripples continue to spread some bigger than others observatories all over the world close their doors and the reasoning is this if you've been looking at the ceiling for decades and couldn't tell it was a ceiling then what good are you every University in the world that has an astronomy or astrophysics program well they don't anymore Stephen Hawking his book writing days are over Carl Sagan no more Nova in syndication I guarantee it those professors are going to have to retool their skills and be prepared to answer one giant question how did you not see it ort their clues people start finger-pointing and it will continue for years and still my fellow flat-earthers will say well hell that doesn't sound too bad so some nerds around the world lose their jobs so what you don't get off that easy is what the finger-pointing at the now-defunct NASA will then turn to finger-pointing at the government who directed the whole thing this is where we run into some dangerous ground involving things like the Ark of the Covenant the Holy Grail and the Ring of Power and you say you lost me I was with you until you started bringing up religious artifacts from movies and you're supposed to be lost of the five major religions we mentioned earlier those being Buddhism Hinduism Judaism Islam and Christianity none have been able to produce a supernatural object over the last five thousand years and trust me it would be beneficial to do so the Ark of the Covenant would benefit Judaism the Holy Grail Christianity and the Ring of Power well that benefits someone else maybe I'll leave alone for now the point is that all religions are actively seeking their leverage against science you've heard of the division between church and state well here it is advantage Church the barrier becomes a giant religious symbol and since it is backed by the big five it also becomes Universal the big five then go into their drawer with a good silver and pull out this belief that was forgotten but not lost and say we knew it all along and science lied to us temporarily all religions unite against science who has been only moderately weakened by the removal of their astronomy and astrophysics divisions but the public won't care because they will listen to the group shouting the loudest and no one yells louder than the church they will scream with righteous fury the dome was built by our God your God and the people will turn to science and hear nothing but crickets and that's where the world changes because in times of great stress the public will want words and while religion has no shortage of them science simply is incapable of taking leaps of faith I'll take a glass half-full approach and say that anyone listening to this is probably an intelligent rational person one who can make informed decisions outside of the conventional doctrine but for every one of you there are hundreds if not thousands of mouth-breathing troglodytes who will not walk but run to the respective house of religion and say you were right about this what else can you teach me this is what fills the current Authority with pause the unknown response to that question with religion take the high road and work with what remains of science to discover the truth it's possible I suppose it's also possible that religion will combine this technologically advanced society with a revitalized and aggressive doctrine that then transforms daily life into something that makes the book 1984 seem like a Saturday morning cartoon show I'm hoping that mankind will prove me wrong but so far that isn't the case so do some of your own research and ask questions please feel free to email me at

is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies the secret oaths and the secret proceedings we decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it even today there is little value in opposing the thread of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions even today there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it and there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment that i do not intend to permit to the extent that it's in my control and no official of my administration whether his rank is high or low civilian or military should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news to stifle dissent to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know for we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day it is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine that combines military diplomatic intelligence economic scientific and political operations its preparations are concealed not published its mistakes are buried not headlined its dissenters are silenced not praised no expenditure is questioned no rumor is printed no secret is revealed no president should fear public scrutiny of his program for from that scrutiny comes understanding and from that understanding comes support or opposition and both are necessary i am not asking your newspapers to support an administration but i am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the american people for i have complete confidence and the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully involved i not only could not stifle controversy among your readers i welcome him this administration intends to be candid about its errors or as a wise man once said an error doesn't become a mistake until you refuse to correct it we intend to accept full responsibility for our errors and we expect you to point them out when we miss them without debate without criticism no administration and no country can succeed and no republic can survive that is why the athenian lawmaker stolen decreated a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy and that is why our crash was protected by the first amendment the only business in america specifically protected by the constitution not primarily to amuse and entertain not to emphasize the trivial and the sentimental not to simply give the public what it wants but to inform to arouse to reflect to state our dangers and our opportunities to indicate our crises and our choices to lead mold educate and sometimes even anger public opinion this means greater coverage and analysis of international news for it is no longer far away and foreign but close at hand and local it means greater attention to improved understanding of the news as well as improved transmission and it means finally the government at all levels must meet its obligation to provide you with the fullest possible information outside the narrowest limits of national security and so it is to the printing press to the recorder of man's deeds the keeper of his conscience the courier of his news that we look for strength and assistance confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be free and independent okay folks uh before we go on to uh taking a look at what i feel happened to uh john f kennedy and the real reason why that he's dead i want to examine uh sorry about that i want to examine very closely the rifle that they said that killed the john kennedy and they proclaim that this gun was uh bought by lee harvey oswald and uh they say that he ordered it through the mail and picked it up i think through sears or something which back in those days you could do guns that way even back in the early 80s around 1980 and stuff you can order guns through the mail you can't do that now you've not been able to do that for some years but back in those days you could now this 6.5 by 52 carcano uh this was an italian gun and if you really don't know what to look at you can really get a lot of misconceptions about this rifle now in the days that we live in uh this gun can easily be confused with the 6.5 swede it can easily be confused with the 6.5 grendel and it can easily be confused with the 6.5 that you can actually buy today and how it's loaded versus how it was loaded back in those days and what was available to the public now there's probably not too many of you know this but back in those days even the the ammunition that was made around 1940 1941 that was not available to the public at that time what they had made available to the public and had released was ammunition that was no longer currently being used by any military and that's why they release it to the public because it's not and that was the old world war one ammunition okay that was used back in world war one because this gun was first devised back in the 1800s see look at this right here it'll tell you that this gun was actually devised see here 1891 1888 to 1891 was when it was first devised and from that point up until world war one was the ammunition that oswald would have had available to him okay so given the fact that we know that that would have to be the ammunition that you would have to take a look at and say is what they say feasible in comparison to what it did and uh i'm just going to tell you me and a friend of mine back when i was around 19 20 years old his name was michael and he is a ballistics expert he really is about the best that i know if anybody from back home is watching this they're going to know who that is but i'm not going to say his last name but his name was michael and he he he's a he's a gun craze man he's been that way his whole life reloading and ballistics and this and that and it just goes on and on but we took some of the ammunition that would have been available to oswald and we went and we conducted some ballistic tests for how far that they said the motorcade was in dallas versus how far they said that this shot was fired with the 6.5 52 car 52 carcano a model 91 italian and uh at that time stuff like this was not available this is new stuff the only thing that would have been available to him would have been old world war one ammunition now how many do you of you know that uh the the the powder back in those days folks the same amount of powder that would have filled this cartridge up to a given amount of length up into the back of the the the bullet would not have produced a compression that world war ii ammunition would have let alone ammunition of today it was slow burning powder it was somewhere between what they used in the old west days and what they used in world war ii and you couldn't get the kind of compression out of that type of ammunition that you could the world war ii ammunition or especially ammunition of today now the way they've got that gun set up today it's a force to be reckoned with but then again they've done everything that way folks used to a 30 30 winchester didn't have much to it and now you can buy that lever revolution ammunition for horndy and it's completely revolutionized to 30 30 winchester now all of a sudden you've got something that would have dropped 11 inches at 100 yards and all of a sudden it's dropping one inch or 200 yards you know that's the difference or 250 yards with a 30 30. so that's the difference but if you're going to take a look at reality when it comes to this what you have to do is you have to take a look realistically at what was available at that time that oswald could have got his hands on to have done this with and so the uh the test that we conducted was that type of ammunition old world war one ammunition that he was able to get a hold of online specifically and folks i'm going to tell you something the conclusion that we came to between he he and i both and especially him which i respected his opinion he knows more about this than i do he said jerry there's absolutely no way whatsoever that that old world war one round that had that slow burning powder in it that was corrosive had corrosive primers in it could have ever done that kind of damage to john f kennedy's head at that at that at that length you had to have a certain amount of pressure folks to equal out that kind of damage because this round blowed his head off literally folks it didn't just enter in and kill him it literally blowed his head off it blowed he'll blow pieces of his brains man onto his wife it blow pieces of his brains out in the streets at the 300 some yards that it was supposed to have done this at the world war one ammunition that would have been available to oswald to do this there's no way that it had that much knockdown power at that amount at that distance to equal up to the damage that was done to his head absolutely no way no way whatsoever folks and so that's the big misconception about today when it comes to this is uh people are looking at this round and they're like well you know it shoots pretty hard or you know this 6.5 grendel they made it shoots hard or this 6.5 italian that was replaced that that shoots hard or this new ammunition that comes out that this 6.5 52 carcano it shoots oh well it all does and it probably all is sort of in the realm of being capable of doing what happened to john kennedy but that's not reality folks the reality of the entire situation is this what he could get a hold of at that time and what he shot supposedly john kennedy with is what you have to realistically go by and what he realistically got a hold of was not capable of doing what it did that bullet went all the way down guys to very low foot pounds at that distance i mean it was lucky to uh i don't know it would have been lucky it would have went through one side of a barrel maybe i'm serious it was just literally just flying at that time it lost all the pressure it had after 125 yards and that's all he had available to him because when they real when they release this military ammunition to the public the reason why they're doing that is they're no longer using it and it's it's just warehouse stock at that point in time and the only thing they had declared the uh with the carcano is not usable at that time was the slow burning powder from the 1800s to world war one so that's all oswald could have got a hold of so there's no way whatsoever that he killed john kennedy with this gun at the length that they said that he did because it could not have created that kind of damage now you're going to say jerry who who did kill him well it really doesn't matter folks the bottom line is he's dead so why does it matter how many shooters they were or whatever the bottom line is he's dead okay i think there was multiple shooters but to sit and and conjure all night is really to get away from the uh realistically the true matter behind why that he was killed and that's more important than how many shooters there were bottom line is guys he's in the grave it doesn't matter if it was two shooters or five shooters what matters is who did it and that's what we're going to examine right here okay hang on you know what folks this just goes to show you all the more just how how uh dishonest that the internet is anymore you can't go by anything the internet has to say anymore it's not the liars anyway your federal reserve banknote is made in switzerland and you you can't get this thing here to tell you that at all harley anymore um it's the rockefellers the rothschilds the warburgs the ships uh jp morgan merrill lynch those are the ones he folks that owns the federal reserve bank now take a look at this it says the federal reserve european central bank and swiss national bank announces expansion it that what do you mean the swiss bank in the federal reserve bank is the same thing see the liars man your your reality has been altered folks look at this swiss 100 being to be installed in climate push but anyway your money's being printed in switzerland and it has been for years okay the federal reserve banknote has nothing whatsoever to do with the federal government in the united states of america it's the bankers of the swiss folks that does this okay that's who prints your money and when they tell you that we're in debt x number of dollars to the federal reserve bank like 307 billion billion trillion dollars or whatever they say this is the people that they say we're in debt to you know same people uh giving you your coven shot right now too okay and i don't know how many of you know this but let's see why are switzerland's foreign assets so low the growing financial exposure of small open economy the federal reserve bank of new york the federal reserve bank is not owned by new york the federal reserve bank is owned by the swiss of switzerland you see how it lies people liars but anyway uh one thing you didn't hear john f kennedy say is not only did he uh denounce the secret societies but he also made a speech and it's been erased everywhere i can't find it anywhere at all but it happened that he said he was going to take the money that we are spending here in the united states and he was going to take it and do away with a foreign country supplying us with that money and we were going to start printing our own money here in the united states okay that's what he said and the money was being printed in switzerland folks and so now uh you're getting closer to the truth and i'm telling you the truth hang on look at this folks i put enough information in i forced it to tell the truth and it wouldn't do it a minute ago look the u.s federal reserve is a privately owned controlled bank by the rothschilds the rockefellers the morgans and prince money by the us government hang on our one moment okay i had to keep this going but there you go folks rothschilds rockefellers the morgans imprints money for the u.s government the true power of the rothschilds goes far beyond the banking empire they are also behind all wars since napoleon i finally forced it through enough information being in there that it was either going to flat out lie to me but guess what folks if i didn't know what to punch in there they never would have told me that okay does the rothschild family control the world money supply here is the truth yeah yeah you ought to look into that one folks there's a place to go to to look at that uh idapod.com rothschildfamily.com company is a good place to go to for that but see it won't tell me this unless i knew what to punch in i already knew it all right hang on there you know what folks it doesn't matter what anybody says or what organizations was involved which all of them are pretty much involved in corruption of this bunch you could say well jerry that uh some of the government had him killed or russia had him killed number one russia had nothing to do with this whatsoever just like osama bin laden didn't have anything to do with 911. he these are the same people that done your 911 that killed john f kennedy same people i promise you it is all controlled by england the crown the rothschilds and rockefellers of switzerland uh which by the way run your government if you think you're free and you think you're electing presidents yeah you've you put yourself in a world of delusions what you put yourself into you you put yourself into the matrix for the sheep because it's never been that way folks every american president that you ever had has been a member of these people so you really think you elected them and every one of those presidents has had blood lineages to a royal king of some kind i guess that's just an accident isn't it telling you the truth guys my grandmother used to hang a uh picture up on her wall of john f kennedy she was really fond of him and folks i will tell you something if it came right down to it i would have to say that that's probably the only president that we had that i would do the same for because the rest of them have all been tricksters deceivers i don't care how charismatic their speeches were i don't they they all belong to this and ultimately this is what has controlled your country and ultimately this is the reason why that john f kennedy got killed because he wanted to do away with the secret societies and he wanted to do away with the federal reserve banknote in switzerland and move it back here to the united states and so now you know thank you for watching my video folks 
on the phone it is a pleasure to welcome Nikko Hines he's the London editor of The Daily Beast and we are talking to him in London at the moment Nikko welcome to the program so this this story is incredibly disturbing that you've published in The Daily Beast I guess it was about a week ago it is about a VIP paedophile Network that was I guess I don't know embedded is the right word but it was within the British government tell us how this this story came to light well how it come out is a really important part of this whole alleged cover-up all the way back in the mid 1980s and there were allegations and rumors about senior members of the British government and about what they may or may not have been getting up to in their private time you have to remember this is a very different world back then the homosexuality had only been legalized relatively recently and the age of consent was 21 so there was a kind of a shadowy ke world in any case so some of these kind of more serious or I shouldn't comparison but because there was a veil of secrecy and a veil of criminality and some people's private lives this was somehow allowed to go on unchecked yet there were rumors now media newspapers some of whom tried to cover this at the time but they were never able to either because the police rushed in to stop them or just because of Britain's very strict libel laws if you're going to make an accusation that somebody was breaking the law and in such a serious way you have to have a lot of proof in all this bill to back up your assertion now so this this this scandal or I should say this this paedophile Network we're not talking I mean are you are you saying that the the we're talking about 20 year olds and it is or are we talking about young children here no we're talking about people from the earliest age that I've seen in the allegations has gone to the police about nine years old so yeah we're talking about serious serious claims the reason I mentioned the older people is just because it gives some context to understand there was a place called dolphin square which was which is located near Westminster near the houses and a lot of MPs lived there because obviously they have their lane owned in the parts of the country that they come from and that they represent them when they're in London to do political business they have flats in this place and it was known that there were some gay parties that had older people in them that were partially secret but what is now being alleged is that there were in fact serious pedophile rings also operating in this okay so let me let me get let me let me just see if I can I can clarify your point here is that because this was at a time where there was I guess essentially gay people were emancipated in some way at least in the context of the law that there was still sort of these vestiges of a a social I guess perspective where you don't really look into what's going on in the personal lives of people because what they may be engaged in may be technically illegal but is not necessarily problematic and some of that I guess modus operandi sort of intersected with what was a which was clearly a different species ie you know pedophilia but those sort of constructs were still sort of like we're blurred because of that it just gave a cover story so you knew that people MP senior MPs who works for the Margaret Thatcher government we're going off doing things that they didn't on everyone to know about but you just kind of assumed that it was something that was technically illegal or perhaps round upon or you know this is a common there weren't publicly gay MPs so you just imagined that what they were doing was actually perfectly reasonable behavior even if it was technically illegal but in fact it now turns out that there were serious crimes being committed okay so in 1983 you write Geoffrey Dickens a controversial MP I'm not clear obviously as an American I'm not two up on my on the the profiles of members of parliament particularly in the 80s but the odds for that matter but he handed a file containing the names of alleged perpetrators to Leon Brittan who was Leon Brittan the Home Secretary which I suppose the most similar position in the u.s. would be kind of director of Homeland Security or something like that someone who's in charge of Britain's police Britain's intelligence agencies but also kind of border control so a very very very influential person in terms of someone who was able to put in place kind of was able to use his influence to make sure that those law enforcement agencies were following his well okay and and so what did he do with this would this I guess this this file of claims hotly contested things that's one and run on this now Geoffrey Dickens publicly said that there was a suggestions of there being a pedophile ring in London amongst politicians at the time now most people thought you know Geoffrey Dickens was a kind of outspoken flamboyant kind of guy most people thought he was probably exaggerating or that they'd gotten the wrong end of the stick nobody necessarily took his claims seriously nonetheless he passed his his dossier of evidence to Leon Brittan my own separate and nothing publicly was ever heard again from that now we subsequently found out that he wrote to Geoffrey Dickens and later to explain that his officials did find enough evidence in there to consider it worthwhile to carry out further investigations but that's the last that we hear about it the whereabouts of that file has is a great mystery there was an investigation last year ordered by the current British government to try and discover where that fire was and that file has been destroyed now we don't know who destroyed it we don't know when it was destroyed but the fact that it is no longer in existence okay and we should say that this this guy Briton Leon Brittan has passed away I mean is that why okay and then tell us who Don Hale is and and what was his role in I guess this revelation newspaper editor he worked in Barry so outside of London and the reason he kind of comes into the story is because he's one of his local politicians who was a senior naval politician at the time went to him and said look I've got evidence about these Peter phone rings now she wasn't necessarily saying that these people all active Peters also she was saying that there was a group called the paedophile information exchange which was working with in Westminster kind of promoting or working for to improve Rights for pedophiles she had evidence that these people were working with in weaving Westminster she wanted the big national press to run a story about it but they were all too scared to run a story about it so she went to her local MP sorry her local newspaper a guy who she knew well done Hale and gave him and that evidence he was skeptical and at least worried about how he'd be able to use the story but he thought at least this thing I can do is like a monastery saying you know well-known local politician barber Castle is worried that there's a pedophile ring in Westminster and she says that it's being investigated by the British government he thought he'd get away with doing that so he started to make a few calls to those some of those people named in the dossier you know sooner did he do that but any politician arrived at the office the very next morning threatening him shouting at him demanding that he hand over the files he refused to hand over those files and then the very next day and police officers from something called Special Branch which is a sort of high up intelligence cold war-era police super squad arrived at the office and took away all the papers took away all the evidence and said that if he were to ever repeat anything that was found within these stolen documents that he would be jailed Wow and so he he didn't I mean how did how do we know his story today well he considered thinking he decided that you know it was a fair cop in a sense because he knew that these documents were stolen or at least we're not supposed to have been shown outside of the Home Office they had you there for your eyes only and classified written on the papers so he knew it was true that he would could get in trouble if he used them and he didn't have any way to prove that these allegations were true so even when he was approached a few years later by the news of the world the famous tabloid newspaper in Britain and blowing from Murdoch about similar allegations he refused to repeat them again then because he was afraid you know he had a family didn't want to go to jail it was only when this story began to really explode in 2012 in Britain when an MP used parliamentary privilege which means you're allowed to make claim against that ended would be considered libelous written in the newspaper it was published or discussed in the radio he used parliamentary privilege to say in the British House of Commons that some of these allegations ought to be examined and that then kicked into gear the British media into really investigating him really examining some of these things and the crucial difference is that quite a lot of these men have subsequently died and so you're now able to repeat some of these allegations which we never proved in a court of law at the time Wow and so I mean and he and so following I guess the the member of the House of Commons sort of saying that we need to more investigation this hail reports this stuff where where is it where where are we now with this or I should say before we get to that how much did Margaret Thatcher I mean how high up did this go that's again something that more and more details of that are emerging as the week's go on at the moment because people are plunging back through the archives and finding old reports finding or classified files and individuals who were involved with Margaret Thatcher are starting to speak out so we had a body one of her bodyguards has come out and said that he warned her about one of her close aides that lots of allegations were made against him we know that Sir Peter Heyman who was one of the top guys mi6 but he named one of Britain's main spy agencies was also caught with Peter for material we know that she was told about that and we can see in her in her hand on a note that was found earlier this year that she says that this shouldn't be made public and then just wait a second I'm sorry what is that last part this she found there was a no OA note that she wrote in her and her handwriting that's right saying that this shouldn't be made public so she knew that these allegations have been made she knew that this guy was responsible not for abusing children but for having pedophile obscene materials and she and she wrote to one of her advisers oh no no no let's make sure this doesn't this doesn't come out it then emerged this weekend that another of these high-profile abusers a man called steel Smith and I advise your listeners to look him up because he's one of the most extraordinary looking him you'll ever see huge fat man weighed about 400 pounds and that used to wear kind of the big bracelet and suspenders he looked he looked kind of like a cartoonish figure of a bad guy and it turned out he wasn't that guy something what something like several hundred complaints were filed against him by boys over a period of decades and again she was she was warned that allegations have been made against him of this nature and she went ahead and gave him a knighthood anyway so he he died as Smith so what is happening I mean how much is this I mean I had your story frankly is the only reporting I've read about this in this in the states here there may be other pieces I just haven't I haven't come across them it's certainly not a story that is making big ribbon so how big of a the story is this in Great Britain I mean it I mean it just seems I mean there's two things that seem really sort of shocking to me one is the cover-up two is you know what why are there so many pedophiles in in and around these governmental positions I mean this is just yeah I it just seems bizarre to me in both instances but what what kind of response are you getting in Great Britain it's one of those things that bubbled and bubbles and bubbled and it's actually I think the it's one of the upsides of the Internet and people being able to publish information and share information in a way that was never possible before so what you had in there the eighties and perhaps in the early 1990s was newspapers hearing rumors hearing suggestions and perhaps even hearing firsthand evidence from one or two people one or two victims someone that abused them or has broken them or in some way but not necessarily there being no photographic evidence or there being no video evidence so it's very difficult with libel laws to be able to report that the what's now happened is that people who either survivors themselves or who the kind of self-appointed sleuth has put together a lot of the missing information into great folders and file and websites where they created this evidence and and it's only become apparent that you know that there were so many people active at the same time well it's hot I'm sorry good no we'll just because major newspapers were afraid to do it and because frankly you know as you found yourself it just doesn't sound believable it doesn't sound but it could be true and how could you possibly write that some of the most senior people in the country are pedophiles just based on the word of one of the children who you can't prove by telling the truth so is there I guess I mean in my mind it would cause me to - I guess question two things one is I mean just a fundamental question of just you know well there's all sorts of issues of what else you know how many other people are being protected for what and in what dynamic and how long this has been going on etcetera etc and I want to address that in a second but what about the libel laws I mean I don't know that Americans are quite aware of just how different your libel law situation is in Great Britain and I wonder if people are questioning the the the value of those or whether or not they need to be reformed in some way because the idea that this could go on and people would be afraid of reporting it seems to me very problematic and a lot of people do you think that there's also a kind of counter-argument I don't know whether you guys has followed we had this big scandal over here and you know Joseph Murdoch and a lot of the British tabloids have come under fire for writing too much making too many salacious claims about celebrities and about people so there's also a strong counter movement as it were but you know I think you can you can look too much into blaming why weren't the media reporting on this and perhaps there's a valid point in that but what the real crux of is why won't the police investigating this why wasn't why won't these people coming up in court because there was evidence people like Cyril Smith was caught with hardcore pornography in his car and yet was allowed to walk through from a police station because there was a phone call from someone in some high-powered office in London they told the local police officers odd you know what do a favor just let this guy walk on his way is there is there has there been any I guess rethink I mean do you think oh that Rose legacy and I don't know that it really I don't know how how great her legacy is frankly anyways in Great Britain for that matter but I mean is this going to impact her legacy and is there are people talking about some form of reform within the government structures I mean there was a quote that you that you used in your piece which as I was reading it I said this sounds like it would be from house of cards in fact it was a storyline pretty close in house of cards from basically a whip saying you know when when members of parliament come to us with these type of problems we're excited about it because it means we help them out and now we own these guys essentially is there any any talk of like we got to figure out a way to make sure that that can't happen and what we have got now and even this in itself has become a massive problem is there's a an enormous inquiry has been launched into harness has covered up how this went on that was announced over a year ago I think now and yet has not even sat for a single hearing yet because there's been so many arguments about who's gonna be in charge and who being able to be responsible for making sure ins as an honest and open inquiry eventually we've they had to get rid of to panel potential kind of judges who were going to be in charge of it because it turned out that they were friends or lived in the same neighborhood for some of the men who were supposedly caught up in it so we've now got a judge from New Zealand who's been kind of who's going to be flown over as an independent adjudicator and it will be her job to go through and to examine how these things were allowed to happen and what should be done in order to make sure that they don't happen again yeah it's crazy and it just seems to me to that you know in this instance it is pedophilia but one wonders how many other violations crimes scandals are quashed or investigations of which are quashed so that these can be used as chits of power in the future yeah absolutely I'm sure it happens a lot in the u.s. perhaps not from these particular grounds but I'm sure similar things happen but it's always been worth in Britain I think because you know we do have a different kind of a society here I don't know if you've seen any of those pictures school pictures as David Cameron and Boris Johnson are London there and George Osborne our top treasury guy you know they were all friends at university they were going went to school it's similar schools it's not the same school and we've got a real problem in Britain and other kind of establishments in a way that I suppose you know the Clintons would aspire to when is a kind of closed part of society who've known each other all their lives and yes when one of them gets in trouble they're going to close ranks and they're gonna try and look out for each other try and make sure that not just because they want to do them a favor as friends or colleagues but because they think that it would look bad to the rest of watching Britain's if it turns out that people who were in this establishment maybe you shouldn't be trusted in the way that they are it's fascinating and you know just go if if molesting and abusing small children is is not enough to have people in your social circle say you know we should we should blow the whistle on this so one wonders what else they can get away with but I appreciate your time Nikko Hines the pieces in The Daily Beast I presume hopefully we'll see more reporting from you going forward on this because it's a just a really just bizarre and fascinating disturbing story I appreciate your coming on talk to us about it interesting all right well we will we will check that out and of course we're going to link to your first piece that majority FM all right Nikko Hines thanks so much for your time today you

Jeffrey Epstein the sexual Jeffrey Dahmer was a notable financier with upwards or possibly exceeding a billion dollars over five luxury residents including a private island for private affairs and most notably Jeffrey Epstein is infamous for being a rapist and a pedophile there are two things here that I've noticed the news has been negligent to cover or largely misleading first of all what Jeffrey Epstein was charged with is in itself a crime he was charged for a second time with two counts of solicitation of prostitution first and foremost his victims that number in the scores possibly exceeding a hundred many underage are victims they are not prostitutes Jeffrey Epstein had a billion dollars when you have a billion dollars everybody in your sphere is paid by you that's what being rich is like if you don't believe me listen to Chris Rock talk about being rich I couldn't find a clip of it but this is an excerpt from Chris Rock's tambourine as most recent special on Netflix and the crazy thing is so after you get through the custody thing then you got to divide the money that's I'm talking scary __ man and whoever whoever makes the most money has to pay the legal fees for the other person so I did pay for a lawyer to divorce me that's like hiring a hitman to kill you it's like okay here's the picture of me I'm gonna be a Burger King at 10:38 okay shoot me in the head and give me a call so I'm in court yeah one day I'm in court and I'm just looking around and you know she got three lawyers I got three lawyers shit's expensive his __ she got three lawyers I got three lawyers the judge that they let this des nog refer and I'm looking at all these __ like I was like wow look at this whole town just here and I'm looking at all these people and I realize like everybody in this room is far more educated than me everybody I dropped out at Boys High okay got College __ coming to me right and I realize everyone in the room born to much better circumstances than me and everybody in there is there to take my money it's like everybody in here is gonna leave with more money except me and they got up that morning they brush their teeth they put on suits they fix their hair with the sole purpose of taking my __ and at that moment I realized something I made it I made it started from the bottom now I'm here I made it man it and after that I was like __ it take it whatever you need take it I'll be all right I'm gonna work gonna be good so it's key that we remember the victims for being victims and hold them to a higher esteem the other thing that is largely misleading is that New York City medical examiner Barbara Sampson declared Jeffrey Epstein's that to be a suicide well Jeffrey Epstein's lawyers say that his death was much more consistent with a murder than a suicide and that's putting it mildly the autopsy showed that Jeffrey Epstein had three fractures to his hyoid bone and his neck a study from 2010 to 2016 showed that in 264 hangings only 16 a mere 16 showed just damage in the hyoid bone for Jeffrey Epstein to a fractured his hyoid bone in three places alone by himself in a jail cell is statistically impossible it's an impossibility also the Wikipedia article on Jeffrey Epstein suggests that Jeffrey Epstein was not only harmed by his cellmate two weeks prior to his death on August 9th or 10th of 2019 he was paying other inmates to keep from being harmed so what do we have here we have a history of violence towards Jeffrey Epstein in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City there is a pattern of abuse and fear for his safety and the statistical impossibility of fracturing your own neck in three places and it so there is no way to do it it's impossible Jeffrey Epstein was murdered there's no ifs ands or buts about it 
on the morning of september 11 2001 19 men armed with box cutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily defended airspace in the world overpowering the passengers and the military combat trained pilots on four commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor these 19 hijackers devout religious fundamentalists who like to drink alcohol snort cocaine and live with pink haired strippers managed to knock down three buildings with two planes in new york while in washington a pilot who couldn't handle a single engine cessna was able to fly a 757 and an 8 000 foot descending 270 degree corkscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground hitting the pentagon in the budget analyst office where dod staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that defense secretary donald rumsfeld had announced missing from the pentagon's coffers in a press conference the day before on september 10th 2001. luckily the news anchors knew who did it within minutes osama bin laden the pundits knew within hours of osama bin laden the administration knew within the day terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them and the evidence literally fell into the fbi's lap the hijackers passport was found blocks from the world trade center crash site if you can believe that but for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on american soil in history that investigation was delayed underfunded set up to fail a conflict of interest and a cover-up from start to finish it was based on testimony extracted through torture the records of which were destroyed it failed to mention the existence of wtc7 able danger p-tech cybele edmunds obl and the cia and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening it was lied to by the pentagon the cia the bush administration and as for bush and cheney well no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret off the record not under oath and behind closed doors it didn't bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is ultimately of little practical significance still the 911 commission did brilliantly answering all of the questions the public had except most of the victims family members questions and pinned blame on all the people responsible although no one so much just lost their job determining the attacks were failure of imagination because opening our government at least and i don't think the prior government could envision flying airplanes in the buildings except the pentagon fema norad and the nro the dia destroyed 2.5 terabytes of data on able danger but that's okay because it probably wasn't important the sec destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading before the attacks but that's okay because destroying the records of the largest investigation in sec history is just part of routine record keeping nist has classified the data that they used for their model of wtc7's collapse but that's okay because knowing how they made their model of the collapse would jeopardize public safety the fbi has argued that all material related to their investigation of 9 11 should be kept secret from the public but that's okay because the fbi probably has nothing to hide this man never existed nor has anything he had to say worthy of your attention and if you say otherwise you are a paranoid conspiracy theorist and deserve to be shunned by all of humanity likewise him him him and her and her and her and him osama bin laden lived in a cave fortress in the hills of afghanistan but somehow got away then he was hiding out in tora bora but somehow got away then he lived in abadabad for years taunting the most comprehensive intelligence dragnet employing the most sophisticated technology in the history of the world for a decade releasing video after video with complete impunity and getting younger and younger as he did so before finally being found in a daring seal team raid which wasn't recorded on video in which he didn't resist or use his wife as a human shield and in which these crack special forces operatives panicked and killed this unarmed man supposedly the best source of intelligence about those dastardly terrorists on the entire planet then they dumped his body in the ocean before telling anyone about it then a couple dozen of that team's members died in a helicopter crash in afghanistan this is the story of 911 brought to you by the media which told you the hard truths about his head could be seen to move violently forward and they took the babies out of incubators and mobile production facilities and the rescue of

"the message you are about to hear was written and recorded on a record in 1956 by Earl Nightingale this message is the answer to the question that he had been searching for from the time he was about nine years old Earl Nightingale had been born and economically depressed times as a child because they were so poor Earl desperately wanted to know why some people grew up to enjoy prosperity while others like his family struggled merely to survive unable to find answers to his questions from grownups girl began reading everything he could believing that someone somewhere had the answer many years passed and when Earl was 35 years old he wrote and recorded this message it was to be played one Saturday morning to a small group of salesmen during his absence when Earl returned he learned that the message had made such a positive impact on the men they wanted copies to share with their friends and family Earl arranged with Columbia Records to duplicate the record to meet the many requests much to Earl's surprise in very little time without any real advertising or marketing over a million copies have been sold and he received a gold record Earl called the message the strangest secret and this single recording was the seedling from which the entire personal development industry grew and because Earl had discovered the true meaning of the strangest secret which determines the outcome of one's life he went from poverty to become one of the most highly recognized voices and names throughout the United States and from the West Indies to South Africa his daily radio program our changing world was the world's most widely sponsored radio program and was her daily across the United States Canada Mexico Australia the Bahamas Guam New Zealand Puerto Rico the Armed Forces radio and 30 countries overseas i'm diana nightingale and since my husband's death in 1989 i have continually looked for new effective ways to continue to share Earle's many messages of inspiration with the world the personal development industry is so vast today and yet people around the world attribute the strangest secret as being the one message that has most positively affected their lives brill revised the strangest secret several times over the past 40 years as times changed because of these changes I believe you will appreciate the historic value of this original recording as you listen you will notice how the statistics reflect those of the mid-1950s you'll also hear Earl mention the other side of the record but 40 years later the message is as true and valuable as it was then now I invite you to sit back relax and enjoy the original the strangest secret by Earl Nightingale I'd like to tell you about the strangest secret in the world not long ago Albert Schweitzer the great doctor and Nobel Prize winner was being interviewed in London and a reporter asked him doctor what's wrong with men today the great doctor was silent a moment and then he said men simply don't think and it's about this that I want to talk with you we live today in a golden age this is an era that man has looked forward dreamed of and worked toward for thousands of years but since it's here we pretty well take it for granted we in America are particularly fortunate to live in the richest land that ever existed on the face of the earth a land of abundant opportunity for everyone but do you know what happens let's take a hundred men who start even at the age of 25 do you have any idea what will happen to those men by the time they're 65 these 100 men who all start even at the age of 25 believe they're going to be successful if you ask any one of these men if he wanted to be a success he'd tell you that he did and you'd notice that he was eager toward life that there was a certain sparkle to his eye and erectus to his carriage and life seemed like a pretty interesting adventure to him but by the time they're 65 one will be rich four will be financially independent five will still be working fifty four will be broke now think a moment out of the 100 only five make the grade why do so many fail what has happened to these Sparkle that was there when they were 25 what's become of the dreams the hopes the plans and why is there such a large disparity between what these men intended to do and what they actually accomplished when we say about five percent achieve success we have to define success and here's the definition success is the progressive realisation of a worthy ideal if a man is working toward a predetermined goal and knows where he's going that man is a success if he's not doing that he's a failure success is the progressive realisation of a worthy ideal Rallo may the distinguished psychiatrist wrote a wonderful book called and search for himself and in this book he says the opposite of courage in our society is not cowardice it is conformity and there you have the trouble today its conformity people acting like everyone else without knowing why without knowing where they're going now think of it in America right now there are over 14 million people 65 years of age and over and about 13 million of these 14 million are broke they're dependent on someone else for life's necessities now we learn to read by the time we're 7 we learn to make a living by the time we're 25 usually by that time we're not only making a living we're supporting a family and yet by the time we're 65 we haven't learned how to become financially independent in the richest land that has ever been known why we can form and the trouble is that we're acting like the wrong percentage group the ninety five percent who don't succeed now why do these people conform well they don't know really these people believe that their lives are shaped by circumstances by things that happen to them by exterior forces their outer directed people a survey was made one time that covered a lot of men working man and these men were asked this question why do you work why do you get up in the morning 19 out of 20 had no idea if you ask them they'll say everyone goes to work in the morning and that's the reason they do it because everyone else is doing it now let's get back to our definition of success who succeeds the only man who succeeds is the man who is progressively realizing a worthy ideal he's the man who says I'm going to become this and then begins to work toward that goal I'll tell you who the successful people are as success is the school teacher who's teaching school because that's what she wanted to do the success is the woman who's a wife and mother because she wanted to become a wife and mother and is doing a good job of it the success is the man who runs the corner gas station because that's what he wanted to do the success is the successful salesman who wants to become a top-notch salesman and grow and build with his organization a success is anyone who is doing deliberately a predetermined job because that's what he decided to do deliberately but only one out of 20 does that that's why today there isn't really any competition unless we make it for ourselves instead of competing all we have to do is create now for 20 years I looked for the key which would determine what would happen to a human being was there a key I wanted to know which would make the future of promise that we could foretell to a large extent was there a key that would guarantee a person's becoming successful if he only knew about it and knew how to use it well there is such a key and I've found it have you ever wondered why so many men worked so hard and honestly without ever achieving anything in particular and others don't seem to work hard and yet seem to get everything they have the magic touch you've heard them say that about someone everything he touches turns to gold and have you ever noticed that a man who becomes successful tends to continue to become successful and on the other hand have you noticed how a man who is a failure tends to continue to fail it's because of goals some of us have them some don't people with goals succeed because they know where they're going now think of a ship leaving a harbor and think of it with the complete voyage mapped out and planned the captain and crew know exactly where it's going and how long it will take it has a definite goal 9999 times out of 10,000 it will get to where it started out to get now let's take another ship just like the first only let's not put a crew on it or a captain at the helm let's give it no aiming point no goal no destination we just start the engines and let it go I think you'll agree with me that if it gets out of the harbor at all it will either sink or wind up on some deserted beach a derelict it can't go anyplace because it has no destination and no guidance it's the same with a human being take the salesman for example there is no other person in the world today with the future of a good salesman selling is the world's highest-paid profession if we're good at it and if we know where we're going every company needs top-notch salesmen and they reward those men the sky is the limit for them but how many can you find someone once said the human race is fixed not to prevent the strong from winning but to prevent a weak from Lou the American economy today can be likened to a convoy in time of war the entire economy is slowed down to protect its weakest link just as the convoy had to go at the speed that would permit its slowest vessel to remain in formation that's why it's so easy to make a living today it takes no particular brains or talent to make a living and support a family today so we have a plateau of so-called security if that's what a person is looking for but we do have to decide how high above this plateau we want to aim for now let's get back to the strangest secret in the world the story that I wanted to tell you today why do men with goals succeed in life and men without them fail well let me tell you something which if you really understand it will alter your life immediately if you understand completely what I'm going to tell you from this moment on your life will never be the same again you'll suddenly find that good luck just seems to be attracted to you the things you want just seem to fall in line and from now on you won't have the problems the worries the knowing lump of anxiety that perhaps you've experienced before doubt fear well they'll be things of the past here's the key to success and the key to failure we become what we think about now let me say that again we become what we think about throughout all history the great wise men and teachers philosophers and prophets have disagreed with one another on many different things it is only on this one point that they are incomplete and unanimous agreement listen to what Marcus Aurelius the great Roman Emperor said he said a man's life is what his thoughts make of it Disraeli said this everything comes if a man will only wait I have brought myself by long meditation to the conviction of a human being with a settled purpose must accomplish it and that nothing can resist a will that will stake even existence for its fulfillment Ralph Waldo Emerson said this a man is what he thinks about all day long William James said the greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their by altering their attitudes of mind and he also said we need only in cold blood act as if the thing in question were real and it will become infallibly real by growing into such a connection with our life that it will become real it will become so knit with habit and emotion that our interest in it will be those which characterized belief he also said this if you only care enough for a result you will almost certainly attain it if you wish to be rich you will be rich if you wish to be learned you will be learning if you wish to be good you will be good only you must then really wish these things and wish them exclusively and not wish at the same time a hundred other incompatible things just as strongly in the Bible you read in mark 9:23 if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth dr. norman vincent peale said this this is one of the greatest laws in the universe fervently do i wish i had discovered it as a very young man it dawned upon me much later in life and i found it to be one of the greatest if not my greatest discovery outside of my relationship to God and the great law briefly and simply stated is that if you think in negative terms you'll get negative results if you think in positive terms you will achieve positive results that is the simple fact which is at the basis of an astonishing law of prosperity and success in three words believe and succeed William Shakespeare put it this way our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt George Bernard Shaw said people are always blaming their circumstances for what they are I don't believe in circumstances the people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they can't find them make them well it's pretty apparent isn't it and every person who discovered this for a while believed that he was the first one to work it out we become we think about now it stands to reason that a person who's thinking about a concrete and worthwhile gold is going to reach it because that's what he's thinking about and we become what we think about conversely the man who has no goal who doesn't know where he's going and whose thoughts must therefore be thoughts of confusion and anxiety and fear and worry becomes what he thinks about his life becomes one of frustration fear anxiety and worry and if he thinks about nothing he becomes nothing now how does it work why do we become what we think about well I'll tell you how it works as far as we know now to do this I want to tell you about a situation that parallels the human mind suppose a farmer has some land and it's good fertile land now the land gives the farmer a choice he may plant in that land whatever he chooses the land doesn't care it's up to the farmer to make the decision now remember we're comparing the human mind with the land because of the mind like the lamb doesn't care what you plant in it it will return what you planned but it doesn't care what you plant now let's say that the farmer has two seeds in his hand one is a seed of corn the other is nightshade a deadly poison he digs two little holes in the earth and he plants both seeds one corn the other nightshade he covers up the holes waters and takes care of the land and what will happen invariably the land will return what is planted as it's written in the Bible as you sow so shall you reap remember the land doesn't care it will return poison and just as wonderful abundance as it will corn so up come the two plants one corn one poison now the human mind is far more fertile far more incredible and mysterious than the land but it works the same way it doesn't care what we plant success/failure a concrete worthwhile goal or confusion misunderstanding fear anxiety and so on but what we plant it will return to us you see the human mind is the last great unexplored continent on the earth it contains riches beyond our wildest dreams it will return anything we want to plant now you might say but if that's true why don't people use their minds more well I think they've figured out an answer to that to our mind comes a standard equipment at birth it's free and things that are given to us for nothing we place little value on things that we pay money for we value the paradox is that exactly the reverse is true everything that's really worthwhile in life came to us free our mind our soul our body our hopes our dreams our ambitions our intelligence our love of family and children and friends all these priceless possessions are free but the things that cost us money are actually very cheap and can be replaced at any time a good man can be completely wiped out and make another fortune he can do that several times even if our home burns down we can rebuild it but the things we got for nothing we can never replace the human mind isn't used merely because we take it for granted familiarity breeds contempt it can do any kind of job we assign to it but generally speaking we use it for little jobs instead of big important ones universities have proved that most of us are operating on about 10 percent of our abilities decide now what is it you want plant your goal in your mind it's the most important decision you ever make in your entire life do you want to be an outstanding salesman a better worker at your particular job do you want to go places in your company in your community all you've got to do is plant that seed in your mind care for it work steadily toward your goal and it will become a reality it not only will there's no way that it cannot you see that is a law like the laws of Sir Isaac Newton the laws of gravity if you get on top of a building and jump off you'll always go down you'll never go up and it's the same with all the other laws of nature they always work they're inflexible think about your goal in a relaxed positive way picture yourself in your mind's eye as having already achieved this goal see yourself doing the things you will be doing when you've reached your goal ours has been called the phenobarbital age the age of ulcers and nervous breakdowns at a time when medical research has raised us to a new plateau of good health and longevity far too many of us worry ourselves into an early grave trying to cope with things in our own little personal ways without learning a few great laws that will take care of everything for us these things we bring on ourselves through our habitual way of thinking every one of us is the sum total of his own thoughts he is where he is because that exactly where he really wants to be whether he'll admit that or not each of us must live off the fruit of his thoughts in the future because what you think today and tomorrow next month the next year will mold your life and determine your future you're guided by your mind I remember one time I was driving through Arizona and I saw one of those giant earthmoving machines roaring along the road at about 35 miles an hour with what looked like 20 tons of dirt in it a tremendous incredible machine and there was a little man perched way up on top with the wheel in his hands guiding it and as I drove along I was struck by the similarity of that machine to the human mind just suppose you're sitting at the controls of such a vast source of energy are you going to sit back and fold your arms and let it run itself into a ditch or are you going to keep both hands firmly on the wheel and control and direct this power to a specific worthwhile purpose it's up to you you're in the driver's seat you see the very law that gives us success is a two-edged sword we must control our thinking the same rule that can lead a man to a life of success wealth happiness and all the things he's ever dreamed of for himself and his family that very same law can lead him into the gutter it's all in how he uses it for good or for bad this is the strangest secret in the world now why do I say it's strange and why do I call it a secret actually it isn't a secret at all it was first promulgated by some of the earliest wise man and it appears again and again throughout the Bible but very few people have learned it understand it that's why it's strange and why for some equally strange reason it virtually remains a secret I believe that you could go out and walk down the Main Street of your town and ask one man after another what the secret of success is you probably wouldn't one into one man in a month who could tell you now this information is enormous ly valuable to us if we really understand it and apply it it's valuable to us not only for our own lives but the lives of those around us our family employees associates and friends life should be an exciting adventure it should never be a bore a man should live fully be alive he should be glad to get out of bed in the morning he should be doing a job he likes to do because he does it well one time I heard Grove Patterson make a speech the editor-in-chief of the Toledo daily Blade and as he concluded his speech he said something that I've never forgotten he said something like this my years in the newspaper business have convinced me of several things among them that people are basically good and that we came from someplace and were going someplace so we should make our time here an exciting adventure the architect of the universe didn't build a stairway leading nowhere and the greatest teacher of all the carpenter from the plains of Galilee gave us the secret time and time again as she believed so shall it be done unto you you on side number one of this record I've explained the strangest secret in the world and how it works now on this side I want to explain how you can prove to yourself the enormous returns possible in your own life by putting this secret to a practical test I want you to make a test that will last 30 days now it isn't going to be easy if you'll give it a good try it will completely change your life for the better back in the 17th century Sir Isaac Newton the English mathematician and natural philosopher gave us some natural laws of physics which apply as much to human beings as they do to the movement of bodies in the universe now one of these laws is that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction simply stated as it applies to you and me it means we can achieve nothing without paying the price the results of your 30-day experiment will be in direct proportion to the effort you put forth to be a doctor you must pay the price of long years of difficult study to be successful in selling and remember that each of us succeeds to the extent of his ability to sell selling our families on our ideas selling education in schools selling our children on the advantages of living the good and honest life selling our associates and employees on the importance of being exceptional people too of course the profession of selling itself but to be successful in selling our way to the good life we must be willing to pay the price now what is that price well it's many things first it's understanding emotionally as well as intellectually that we literally become what we think about that we must control our thoughts if we're to control our lives it's understanding fully that as you sow so shall you reap secondly it's cutting away all the fetters from the mind and permitting it to soar as it was divinely designed to do it's the realization that your limitations are self-imposed and that the opportunities for you today are enormous beyond belief it's rising above narrow-minded pettiness and Prejudice thirdly to use all your courage to force yourself to think positively on your own problem to set a definite and clearly defined goal for yourself to let your marvelous mind think about your goal from all possible angles to let your imagination speculate freely upon many different possible solutions to refuse to believe there are any circumstances sufficiently strong to defeat you in the accomplishment of your purpose to act promptly and decisively when your course is clear and to keep constantly aware of the fact that you are at this moment standing in the middle of your own acre of diamonds as Russell Conwell used to point out fourth save at least 10% of what you earn it's also remembering that no matter what your present job it has enormous possibilities if you're willing to pay the price now let's just go over the important points in the price each of us must pay to achieve the wonderful life that can be ours it is of course worth any price one you will become what you think about to remember the word imagination let your mind soar three courage concentrate on your goal every day for save 10% of what you earn and action ideas are worthless unless we act on them now I'll try to apply in the 30-day test I want you to make now keep in mind that you have nothing to lose by making this test and everything you could possibly want to gain there are two things that may be said of everyone each of us wants something and each of us is afraid of something I want you to write on a card what it is you want more than anything else it may be more money perhaps you'd like to double your income or make a specific amount of money it may be a beautiful home it may be success at your job it may be a particular position in life it could be a more harmonious family each of us wants something right down on your card specifically what it is that you want make sure it's a single goal and clearly defined you needn't show it to anyone but carry it with you so that you can look at it several times a day think about it in a cheerful relaxed positive way each morning when you get up and immediately you have something to work for something to get out of bed for something to live for look at it every chance you get during the day and just before going to bed at night as you look at it remember that you must become what you think about and since you're thinking about your goal you realize that soon it will be yours in fact it's yours really the moment you write it down and begin to think about it look at the abundance all around you as you go about your daily business you have as much right to this abundance as any other living creature it's yours for the asking now we come to the difficult part difficult because it means the formation of what is probably a brand new habit and new habits are not easily formed once formed however it'll follow you for the rest of your life stop thinking about what it is you fear each time a fearful or negative thought comes into your consciousness replace it with a mental picture of your positive and worthwhile goal there will come times when you will feel like giving up it's easier for a human being to think negatively than positively that's why only 5% is successful you must begin now to place yourself in that group for 30 days you must take control of your mind it will think only about what you permitted to think each day for this 30 day test do more than you have to do in addition to maintaining a cheerful positive outlook give of yourself more than you've ever done before do this knowing that your returns in life must be in direct proportion to what you give the moment you decide on the goal to work toward you're immediately a successful person you're then in that rare and successful category of people who know where they're going out of every hundred people you belong to the top five don't concern yourself too much with how you're going to achieve your goal leave that completely to a Power greater than yourself all you have to do is know where you're going the answers will come to you of their own accord remember these words from the Sermon on the Mount and remember them well keep them constantly before you this month of your test ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened it's as marvelous and as simple as that in fact it's so simple that in our seemingly complicated world it's difficult for an adult to understand that all he needs is a purpose and faith for 30 days do your best if you're a Salesman go at it as you've never done before and not in hectic fashion but with the calm cheerful assurance that time well spent we'll give you the abundance in return you deserve and want if you're a homemaker devote your 30 day test to complete giving of yourself without thinking about receiving anything in return and you'll be amazed at the difference it makes in your life no matter what your job do it as you've never done it before for 30 days and if you've kept your goal before you every day you'll wonder and marvel at this new light you found Dorothea brand outstanding editor and writer discovered it for herself and tells about it in her fine book wake up and live her entire philosophy is reduced to the words act as though it were impossible to fail she made her own test with sincerity and faith and her entire life was changed one of overwhelming success now you wait your test for 30 full days don't start your test until you've made up your mind to stick with it you see by being persistent you're demonstrating faith persistence is simply another word for faith if you didn't have faith you would never persist if you should fail during your first 30 days by that I mean suddenly find yourself overwhelmed by negative thoughts you've got to start over again from that point and go 30 more days gradually your new habit will form until you find yourself one of that wonderful minority to whom virtually nothing is impossible don't forget the card it's vitally important as you begin this new way of living on one side of the card write your goal whatever it may be on the other side write the words we've quoted from the Sermon on the Mount ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you in your spare time during your test period read books that will help you inspirational books like the Bible dorothea brands wake up and live the magic of believing by clogged Bristol think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill and other books that instruct and inspire nothing great was ever accomplished without inspiration see that during these crucial first 30 days your own inspiration is kept at a peak above all don't worry worry brings fear and fear is crippling the only thing that can cause you to worry during your test is trying to do it all yourself know that all you have to do is hold your goal before you everything else will take care of itself remember also to keep calm and cheerful calm and cheerful don't let petty things annoy or get you off course now the sense making this test is difficult some may say well why should I bother well look at the alternative no one wants to be a failure no one really wants to be a mediocre individual no one wants a life constantly filled with worry fear and frustration therefore remember that you must reap that which you sow if you sow negative thoughts your life will be filled with negative things if you sow positive thoughts your life will be cheerful successful and positive now gradually you will have a tendency to forget what you've heard on this record play it often keep reminding yourself of what you must do to form this new habit gather your whole family about and listen to what's been said here at regular intervals in all most men will tell you that they want to make money without understanding the law the only people who make money work in the mint the rest of us must earn money this is what causes those who keep looking for something for nothing or a free ride to fail in life the only way to earn money is by providing people with services or products which are needed and useful we exchange our product or service for the other man's money therefore the law is that our financial return will be in direct proportion to our service success is not the result of making money making money is the result of success and success is in direct proportion to our service most people have this law backwards they believe that you're successful if you earn a lot of money the truth is that you can only earn money after you're successful it's like the story of the man who sat in front of the stove and said to it give me heat and then I'll add the wood how many men and women do you know or do you suppose there are today who take the same attitude toward life there are millions we've got to put the fuel in before we can expect heat likewise we've got to be of service first before we can expect money don't concern yourself with the money be of service build work dream create do this and you'll find there's no limit to the prosperity and abundance that will come to you prosperity is founded upon a law of mutual exchange any person who contributes to prosperity must prosper in turn himself sometimes the return will not come from those you serve but it must come to you from someplace for that is the law for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction as you go daily through your 30-day test period remember that your success will always be measured by the quality and quantity of service you render and money is a yardstick for measuring this service no man can get rich himself unless he enriches others there are no exceptions to a law you can drive down any Street in America and from your car estimate the service that's being rendered by the people living on that street had you ever thought of this yardstick before it's interesting some like ministers and priests and other devoted people measure their returns in the realm of the spiritual but again their returns are equal to their service once this law is fully understood any thinking person can tell his own fortune if he wants more he must be of more service to those from whom he receives his return if he wants less he has only to reduce this service this is the price you must pay for what you want if you believe you can enrich yourself by deluding others you can only end by deluding yourself just as surely as you breathe you'll get back what you put out don't ever make the mistake of thinking you can avert this it's impossible the prisons and the streets were the lonely walk are filled with people who tried to make new laws just for themselves we may avoid the laws of man but there are greater laws that cannot be broken an outstanding medical doctor recently pointed out six steps that will help you realize success 1 set yourself a definite goal to quit running yourself down 3 stop thinking of all the reasons why you cannot be successful and instead think of all the reasons why you can for trace your attitudes back through your childhood and try to discover where you first got the idea you couldn't be a success if that's the way you've been thinking 5 change the image you have of yourself by writing out a description of the person you would like to be and 6 act the part of the successful person you have decided to become the doctor who wrote those words is a noted West Coast psychiatrist David Herold Fink MD do what all the experts since the dawn of recorded history have told you you must do pay the price by becoming the person you want to become it's not nearly as difficult as living unsuccessfully make your 30-day test then repeat it then repeat it again each time it will become more a part of you until you'll wonder how you could ever have lived any other way live this new way and the floodgates of abundance will open and pour over you more riches than you may have dreamed existed money yes lots of it but what's more important you'll have peace you'll be in that wonderful minority who lead calm cheerful successful lives start today you have nothing to lose but you have a life to win"
well ladies and gentlemen good afternoon to you what an absolute pleasure to be here quick question who here owns a Ferrari seriously not a single one a couple of weeks ago I saw something that you don't see every single day it was an accident between a Ferrari and a VW Golf by the time that I arrived the VW Golf was on one side of the road and it was a little shorter than it was meant to be originally and on the other side of the road was this what used to be a six foot three gleaming red Ferrari but was now a four foot two slightly more crunchy Ferrari and you drive past that and you think to yourself that's a really bad day for some wealthy individual and it's not something you see every day so I pulled my car over I put a little fit a comment on Facebook and I said let's have a moment of silence for the mighty fallen never again to go from nought to a hundred in six point three or three point six seconds and the reaction that I got from some of my friends on Facebook was interesting people said they didn't say things like what a shame what a pity our what a loss they said serves him right and the hatred just kept on coming one comment after another how can he drive a car like that in a country like this our roads are wrong for it he was probably drunk one person stopped just short of accusing him of being a child molester and it was fascinating to me just to see the level of hatred aimed at this Ferrari driver now here's the interesting bit about it the only information that I put on Facebook was there has been an accident between a golf and a Ferrari that's it we don't know who was wrong we don't know if it was the golf driver who made the mistake we don't know if a dog didn't run across the road and caused this thing but what was interesting is it showed up a belief system that most of us don't even know we have it's a bias against the rich it's fascinating now in a room like this we are all studying and working toward building careers building futures becoming high net-worth individuals let me ask you a question do you reckon you can become a high net worth individual at the same time as hating wealthy people it's a self-limiting belief and it actually gets in the way but what's fascinating is that the kind of thinking that is handed down to us from generation to generation is invisible it was once beautiful wasn't it and I'm not the only person who's actually seen this in motion anybody here watch Top Gear yes yeah absolutely Top Gear fans join me for a moment here the rest of you can just go to sleep Jeremy Clarkson says in the United States you watch a person drive by in a Bentley and the reaction is one day I'll be in one of those and he says it's different in Britain he says in Britain you watch a guy drive past in the Bentley and you say one day I'll have him out of that that's a bit more sinister isn't it a little bit darker and it's really interesting because particularly in South Africa we have spent decades trying to unravel a belief system about racism that's been handed down from generation to generation but we are not aware of other beliefs that are handed down to us particularly beliefs about wealthy people and here we all are chasing these goals and chasing these lives while at the same time feeling uncomfortable about talking about money or talking about wealthy people as though they are obviously evil they come from the devil let's take a look at how this thinking is created how its generated how its handed down from generation to generation and how it can stop you from achieving your goals the point is to unravel it get it out of our minds X I sit be rid of it be free of it so that we can actually chase the goals that we have in life and become all God intended us to be in my family if you go back two generations to my grandmother she used to work at an English manor house in Manchester is anyone here ever watched the show on TV quite a quite amateur show called Downton Abbey anyone seen it no okay the basic idea is you've got two sets of people you've got the higher class folks who own this Abbey they're kind of semi royalty in the in the United Kingdom then you've got the people downstairs who run everything they do the cooking they do the sweeping the cleaning it's the the staff my grandmother was part of the manor house but she was not the people upstairs she was the people downstairs she was one of the maid servants who helped to keep this manor house clean and if you have to see pictures of the way that they dressed at the time it was the full old-style regalia she had the little apron and the little maids outfit and the little feather duster and it's everything we think of a slightly kinky today but of course at the time it was nothing like that this was a woman who worked incredibly hard from dusk till dawn this was a woman whose back was sawed more often than not this was a woman who if you ever met her and put your hands on her hands you'd find nothing but calluses and most importantly this was a woman who had no voice in the face of authority because the thinking back then for both the lower classes and for women was keep quiet don't make waves be a cog in the system we don't want to know that you exist we just want to see that your job gets done and this is the kind of thinking that is then handed down from generation to generation and what's interesting is that when my dad came along my grandmother was looking for the best advice she could possibly give to him about work and wealth and how to make your way in the world she went rummaging around in her mind and she came up with this Jim and it was the advice she gave to my dad she said my son get a trade that way you will never starve to death who here has heard some variation of that advice yeah yeah a lot of us have heard things down those lines there's nothing wrong with getting a trade you can become a plumber and you can become very wealthy as a plumber but listen to the second half of that sentence did she say so that you can become all god intends you to be is it so that you can let your light shine so that you can become wealthy so that you can achieve goals no it's so that you never starve to death the thinking comes from a place of desperation and that's the thinking that's handed down generation to generation and the weird part is it's completely invisible to us we hear this advice and we think it's right and we think it's normal now I'm not picking on my grandmother she was doing the best she could with the ideas that she had without perhaps knowing how much damage it can do to future generations take a look at the building you see behind me there that is an Industrial Revolution era factory it's about a hundred maybe 120 years ago what other building that we have today looks very similar to that factory out loud what do you think hospitals what else schools schools yeah schools and here's an interesting one r-run according to the Industrial Revolution age of thinking picture this for a second you drop your kids off at school or you as a child or dropped off at school and you line up in neat lines and the foreman I mean the teacher blows the whistle or rings the bell and in your neat lines you go to your workstation and you sit down you sit down at your little workstation and you work for a number of hours and then the foreman I mean the teacher blows the whistle rings the bell and you take out your little lunch box and you can have some food then the whistle goes again you go back into your work station you sit down it is run according to an industrial revolution era Factory why because we are training human beings to be cogs in a system and we're still doing it hey now I'm not picking on schools here the point is not to say that schools are badly run the point is just to say we have thinking that is invisible to us we are trained to thought and we are culture alized to act in certain ways that no longer make sense in the modern economy the old world thinking says become a cog in a system fit in don't make waves and if you're a perfect cog you'll get you a little bit of money at the end of the day and you can go home that thinking will keep you poor so what are some of the alternatives well that's what I'd like to look at with you here today I like to call that style of thinking the wheelbarrow way it basically goes like this it's like the parents get hold of their child the young son the young daughter they say my son my daughter you are young and strong you must go out into the world and earn coins here's how you do it pick up your wheelbarrow load it full of bricks and for every hour that you push your wheelbarrow you will get one coin if you want a second coin you have to push your wheelbarrow for a second hour now we think like that we go the only way to earn coins is to work for a set number of hours so let me go and get a job and be dead on a boss now you work your set number of hours every day you push your wheelbarrow for your set number of hours and a horrible thing starts to happen you start to realize that you can't quite afford the car you're not quite breaking even with the kids and their education and the debit orders and the bonds and so on so what do you do you go back to the thinking that was handed down to you and you say if I'm not getting enough coins what do I have to do I have to push a second wheelbarrow in the evenings to get more coins that kind of thinking keeps families in generational cycles of poverty if you take nothing else away from today this is the one principle that is the most important do not tie your earning to the number of hours you work you've got to separate those two and I'll show you how today but so long as we think a number of hours equals a number of coins we are in financial trouble because as a human being you only have so many hours in the day the wealthy person's epiphany the way of breaking out of this idea is this dump the bricks in your wheelbarrow get rid of them load your wheelbarrow up with gold in other words for every hour that you push that wheelbarrow you need to raise the value of your work earn more coins per hour not work more hours in order to get more coins so that make sense okay of course that raises some interesting questions are how the heck do you do that there are definitely ways of doing it what are some of the things that our families teach us about work and about wealth and about how economies work and once again it's not to say that they are trying to do damage in our lives they are doing the best they can with the thinking handed down to them but the world has changed what are some of the things that they teach us work hard there's nothing wrong with working hard I believe in working hard but the goal is actually to make money not to work hard and there is a very big difference there in certain companies people think you are fantastic if you are working hard not necessarily if you are being effective so what they do is people make a show of the number of hours that they work how they work over weekend how they part of every meeting they're not necessarily getting stuff done but they're showing that they're working hard yeah that's the difference the next thing is play it safe play it safe wealthy people take risks all the time the middle classes and poor folks take no risks at all in fact I heard a phrase the other day that's just been resonating in my mind that says the middle classes are paralyzed by doubt they are secure to the point of paralysis they do not take risks and of course the thinking handed down there is get a safe job and let someone else take care of you be like everyone else here's an obvious thing that has to be said if you be like everyone else you're gonna earn like everyone else if you choose the safe route in life you are choosing to earn less than you potentially could so today let's talk about the idea of recession versus abundance you've probably heard I mean it's all over the world news and it's in every newspaper every blog everywhere you go the recession that we've been talking about that kicked in in 2008 what's interesting about recessions is not what's going on in the world what's going on in your Innerspace up here there are for example speakers in my industry who have decided that there is a recession and have earned a heck of a lot less as a result then there are other speakers was a gibe particular guy in the states named randy gage who said in 2008 the world issued an invitation to go into recession and I politely declined and he says he's had his best year ever every single year since then because what happens is when we are told that there is a recession we stop acting in ways that generate money because we believe that people aren't buying we haven't discovered a recession we have bought into the concept of a recession there are certain companies who have had their best years ever since right the way through this recession because they simply don't believe in it today I'd like to share with you a tip eight ideas eight ways of overhauling your thinking that have to do with work and wealth and my promise to you is that they are going to be uncomfortable I hear to make people feel good but this stuff is massively important it's important because we are still being taught the ways to work that are outdated the world changes but we're still practicing the old ways if you do do the Twitter thing you're more than welcome to tweet about it as you go along I see a couple of people grabbing their phones when you see the eight yeah if you want to connect with me on Twitter use at Douglas Kruger yeah you can say this guy is talking a load of rubbish or this is a valuable idea whatever but I warn you I'm going to close the doors and check every tweet before I let you out I will find you epiphany number one resenting the wealthy says more about us than it does about the wealthy there's a phrase that my family always used to use and when I was young we struggled really really badly with poverty we had some incredibly rough winters one that I remember we went through the whole of July with our power cut off we had our local church bringing food baskets to our house and I lived in a pretty decent neighborhood and we were the odd ones out so it's quite rough to go through that sort of thing and to have someone else feeding your family when your own parents can't it was a difficult time to go through but what's most interesting to me now looking back on that time period is the kind of language that my family used around the dinner table has your family ever used a phrase like how the other half live when they talk about rich people yeah you know what it's like it's like rich people are a different species the way that I'd like you to look at the difference between where you are and wealth is I want you to look at it as a curve because if it is a curve you can move along that curve you can go from where you are now to your goals but if you buy into that thinking that says rich people are just a different species then instead of a curve there's just a chasm there's a hole there is an absolute void between where you are and where you to be and if you don't believe that it's possible to move along that transition you don't act in ways that start to move you there the first the starting point in becoming a high net worth individual is the belief that it is possible that a wealthy person is not a different species they're just further along on a continuum they have more education about what brings in money and how to achieve goals than what you currently have and that's okay because that represents hope that means you can learn these things you can do them resenting the wealthy says more about us than it does about the wealthy we often think about wealthy people as they're obviously evil they're obviously corrupt they obviously stepped on people's faces to get where they are now Forbes magazine paints a different picture of that they take the highest-earning individuals on the planet and they look at how much they give the stats bear out that wealthy people give more per capita than anyone else we're not just talking about more money because they actually have more we're talking about more per individual in percentage form the idea that wealth people are wealthy people are obviously stingy obviously evil is not borne out by statistics yeah of course there's obviously the odd jerk you will meet the odd horrible rich person they're out there certainly in their numbers but by and large it is not a valid rule that's number one number two there are three things that money is not money is not the root of all evil that's not what the verse says what does the verse say the love of money and it also doesn't say is the root of all evil it says something down the lines of is the root of many kinds of evil now think about what that belief would do to Christian families people of faith if it becomes a locked-in belief and it's handed down generation to generation money is the root of all evil okay so if I chase it there's something wrong with me you can't hold that belief and become wealthy the two do not work together and that's one of those things that we need to check out it's a misquote of the original verse and it's damaging it does a lot of harm particularly to people of faith money is the first thing money is not the root of all evil the second thing money is not embarrassing could you be rich with a straight face time to face that question because you are on a career trajectory that can potentially make you very wealthy could you handle it what kind of human being would you be once you get there yeah wealth simply makes you an amplified version of yourself so what are you if you're a horrible person a rich version of you is going to be a horrible person who's able to do more if you're a good person who likes to help others a rich version of you will be an amplified version of that their money is not embarrassing and if we are embarrassed by money it changes a number of things around the dinner table as a family we won't talk about it no no the middle classes like to talk about how hard we're working but we never talked about how to earn money or how to lose money all of the rules of money you get into the home of wealthy people and that's what they talk to their children about because they think it's important money is not embarrassing we must talk about it and number three you'll see that little pool on the screen their money is not finite it is not finite it is not a limited resource if I take some over here there's less for you money doesn't work that way I have a friend who studied to be a doctor she actually qualified no in fact forgive me I got that one wrong she is a qualified lawyer passed her bar exam and what she then did because she was married to a guy who is quite wealthy she said I'm not going to practice law because if I practice law I get a salary and that means slightly less money for other people folks the thinking is wrong she has the world's best intentions there but what she's actually doing is failing to contribute a little bit to the total amount of money available work doesn't take money out of a system it adds it to it the more people we have running their own businesses the more people we have selling the more people we have doing stuff the more there is for all bring your skill to this country bring your talent earn money for yourself the more you have the more there is in totality it's also very interesting because in different countries they think about the finite nature of money in different ways Korea about 10 20 years ago they decided that they wanted to do economic upliftment for the majority of their people so what did they do they took a look at America and they said I reckon we contact we can take on their car industry and we can take on their IT industry have you ever heard of Samsung yeah have you ever heard of any of the Korean car brands yeah Hyundai and what's the other one Kia and they are absolutely conquering the world right now because what they've decided to do is to grow now other countries around the world and in fact South Africa is a prime example we go oh there's a finite amount of money so if we want to make some people rich what are we going to do if we're going to take from others rather than growing the entire pool bring your skill grow the country we need entrepreneurs we often talk about how much we need jobs you can't falsely create a job my next question to you is why the heck would you want a job you can't get wealthy in a job but that's what we're taught as middle-class people we're taught be like everyone else get a good safe job ok we'll talk about that one in just a moment as well number three represent yourself represent yourself there's a fantastic book and when I'm king of the world I'm going to make it mandatory reading for everyone it's called outliers by Malcolm Gladwell anyone here read that yeah I highly recommended Malcolm Gladwell outliers he talks about the difference between people who fail and succeed in anything and he talks about how in wealthy families they teach their children something very different to what is taught in middle class and poorer families and it's just how to interact with Authority the middle classes and poorer people are taught to fear Authority and it's industrial revolution thinking you've got to fear the guy who runs the factory because he owns your life yeah and it goes like this let's take a practical example they do this one in the book he says you're taking your child to the dentist the middle-class family will teach the child that the dentist is God he has studied for eight years and he knows everything there is to know you as the child must shut up sit down keep quiet and even if it hurts don't cry just wait for it to be over do whatever he tells you to do now in wealthy families they approach the exact same situation completely differently driving to the dentist's office they tell the child the dentist is your friend he has studied for eight years so that he can serve you properly how's that Hey the dentist is a resource that you can use if you have any questions about your mouth about your teeth about anything that you want to know there you must ask the dentist because it's his job to help you now take that kind of thinking that's a simple example going to the dentist take that kind of thinking and amplify it over the next 20 years which of those two kids is going to do well in life you've got one who's taught to fear Authority shut up keep your voice down don't make waves and the other one who's taught the world is there for you to utilize it's all resources you can use it to your own ends imagine the difference that that would make represent yourself and we need to teach our children to represent themselves as well we have been conned into an industrial revolution myth that says authorities in charge and knows best you must shut up and do what you're told you must be a cog in a system and as long as you are doing your job perfectly and not making waves you'll be fine that thinking is a hundred years outdated we cannot teach it any longer number three number four inspired ideas this is one of my favorites as you go about building your career there are the things that you need to do on a day to day basis that slowly gradually move you up that curve toward wealth and if you keep doing them slowly and consistently and gradually every single day ultimately your life is going to improve and you must do those things however from time to time we get that one inspired idea that crazy thought that thing that pops into our heads are we go what if and it's those ideas which in one go can add an extra zero to your income you must have them you must act on them I'll give you a simple practical example in 2006 I had a book published on public speaking and it went through a traditional publisher in Cape Town it went into the bookstores and sold for about a hundred and fifty R and a book of which I got a trans 75 that's how much the author actually gets still I was really chuffed to have this book published and it's a bit of credibility for me as a speaker and it did bring in some money now one of my professional speaker friends said Doug don't do it that way the next time you write a book publish it yourself you pay for the printing you pay for everything and sure it's a bit of money up front but after that you can sell the book at a complete profit and I had this inspired idea I thought wait a minute what if you took that one step further what if you got somebody else to pay for the book so I literally walked in the front door of one of my biggest clients old mutual fair Bain Capital and I spoke to one of the directors and I said how do you feel about giving me a hundred and fifty thousand Rand two minutes later after he'd said yes we were discussing his next yachting holiday I took the chance I tried and it worked he paid for a thousand copies of two separate books and I've been selling them ever since no money down every book that I sell is pure profit margin hey you're starting to see how like thinking differently means different levels of income you can get a salary at the end of the month or you can do things for yourself and generate your own income with inspired ideas now that's just a small one but that brought in firstly it meant I didn't have to pay a hundred and fifty thousand rand and then beyond that it meant something like three four four five hundred thousand rands worth of book sales over the years and that's just one small thing that made a massive impact on my life but I had to represent myself I had to have the idea I had to walk through the door and just have the gumption to try to ask to not be a cog in a system that just does its function perfectly to be a human being with a face and a voice and thoughts creative ideas and an opinion and that can change the scale of your income that's number four number five number five is an abstract idea leaving the ranks of the poor may mean leaving the ranks of the poor that makes sense get will in a moment a while ago I was driving past a particularly poor area it was one of these places where on the side of the road you see these dogs with the sort of ribs sticking out and I mean it's all dust and poverty and hardship and you know I look at that sort of thing in it it saddens me that human beings still have to live under conditions like that here you think about it as a species we're at the level where we're each of us I mean how many people around the room are holding personal computers in their own hands in the form of an own or an iPad or whatever the case might be we have that kind of technology we send satellites out into space we are able to take a photograph of Earth from millions of miles away and then send it back through the void and look at that picture we have astonishing levels of achievement and yet we still have families who don't have enough to eat every day that's awful now dry I happen to be on my way to a conference where I was speaking about an entrepreneurial idea how to make money and I thought to myself just a mental exercise if I was stripped of all of the stuff that I use every day the suit the car the equipment the bits and pieces there the toys if I was stripped of all of that and just left with my knowledge my wits and my education and put into this scenario living in abject poverty could I get back out could I get back out and back to my own life what do you think and could you yeah okay most of the people around this room are kind of saying yes now that's an interesting thought let's take that thought one step further if I had to take a high net worth individual someone who does Drive the Ferrari the Lamborghini someone with their own private helicopter with their own business whatever the case might be and I transplanted them into your life do you think they would be able to get back out if we say yes to that then what we're saying is the gap between where you are and where that person is is up here and then a horrifying thought but at the same time it represents hope because it means it can be done it means that the thought is out there the ideas are out there the knowledge the education is available it can be done leaving the ranks of the poor however may mean leaving the ranks of the poor my thought process went like this I thought maybe I'd start up a small company something that doesn't doesn't require a lot of startup capital maybe a little store maybe I'd get other people to work for me and then I kind of stopped enough so I thought to myself that's not what I do the first thing I do is to physically leave and go somewhere else why because often in situations like that the thinking is depressed and it's not it's not to point fingers or to point blame I mean I've been in a family that has gone through extreme poverty but when you've had generations of poverty it's almost impossible to believe it's possible the thinking becomes depressed there's a speaker in the States these days who has an interesting concept and I believe it he says you are likely to be about as wealthy and about as successful as the average of the five people closest to you think about that for a second who are your closest five it's likely to be probably something like mom dad best friend boss teacher something down those lines chances are it's those people how wealthy are they I'm sorry to ask the question but apparently those stats bear out because what happens is we get involved in an ecosystem of thinking and we all affect one another with our level of aspiration a level of ideas our thinking about work and wealth and we all Everage each other out there's something you can do about this one you don't have to dump your mom okay you don't have to dump the best friend anything down those lines what it is saying is we do need to associate with highly successful individuals we need to expose ourselves to that kind of thinking unless we do we are not going to lift ourselves up but the thinking is out there and quite often people are quite willing to be mentors friends to share answers share ideas sometimes they're not it's always worth asking worth the approach you are likely to be about as wealthy or about as successful as the average of the five people closest to you here's an uncomfortable question is your state's thinking keeping you put can you think of one policy just one then we have in this country that tries to help people but actually promotes poverty anyone social grants yeah think about it this way around what a great idea you've got a young mom who falls pregnant has a couple of kids she's on her own she has no way of earning an income so what we do we give us some money brilliant idea except then of course the opposite happens you have a young woman who goes you know what I'd like some money some money so I'm going to become a young mom in order to get it there is that likely to help them to become incredibly prosperous no is your state's thinking keeping you poor number six your positioning determines your pay scale it is not the quality of your work that determines your income you can be the best in the world at a certain thing and be out earned by someone who is not the best in the world your positioning determines your pay scale let's put this in very simple terms if you're the celebrity of your industry you're going to out-earn the non celebrity of your industry even if that guy's better at it than you let's take for example anyone here watch the cooking show with Nigella Lawson seen her on TV yeah yeah absolutely Nigella Lawson do you reckon she is one of the top five chefs in the world no I don't think so do you think she's in the top hundred mmm I don't think so do you reckon she's in the top thousand I don't think so so why is she out earning all of them because she's Nigella Lawson I'll give you another example if an unknown speaker comes and stands in front of you that person can put in an invoice fourth X number of zeros at the end of an hour of speaking Richard Branson walks into the room and chats with you for five minutes they will add three more zeros to his fee it's not because he worked harder and it's not because he's a better speaker it's because he's Richard Branson you need to be the icon the expert the celebrity the big name in your industry now here's where most people get it wrong they say knowledge is everything knowledge is important but you also have to bring personality that's what Nigella Lawson is doing she is able to speak well in front of a camera she's pretty she's seductive yeah now this is all the stuff that we are never taught as important we are taught what's important is be a cog in a system don't make waves function perfectly get your job done imagine if Nigella Lawson did that she'd be poor all she'd ever do is cook in the kitchen maybe earn like five bucks once in a while yeah but because she brings humanity to it she brings to it things that cannot be done by a computer that cannot be done by a system anything that can be systematized computerised commoditized is unvalued all we're still teaching our kids to study IT that's a low income future because there's like two billion other people studying IT and most of it will be done by the computer itself like tomorrow that's how fast it's moving there's at one of those talks on Ted the inspirational talks website where a guy says and this is quite interesting he says the economy of tomorrow will not be ruled by people who have doctorates or who have studied IT or anything technical the economy of tomorrow will be ruled by people who did bas and know how to think creatively because the computer can't do that it's the people who bring their personality their humanity you become an icon in their industry so it's not just about how good you are technically at what you do it's about being the human being to face the voice the one we see in the media in magazines hear on the radio are you an icon that way you earn more number seven this one's more for companies but it's useful to us as well don't fixate on the bottom line what most companies tend to do is when they think about their finances they put 80 percent of their energy into saving what they have and 20 percent of their energy into earning more we need to reverse that saving of course is important yes you can save yourself rich if you've got like 150 years to live what's more important is actually generating more income picture a clan of people now I want you to just use your imaginations here let's go back thousands of years in time we're sitting at the outskirts of our cave we are a plan and we're facing winter winter is like recession winter is trying winter is deadly to us and our economy is made up of Buffalo we eat them to survive we wear their coats in order to survive this horrific winter the hunters have been out into the field and good news they came back with three Buffalo but three Buffalo is not quite enough for our entire clan to make it through the winter we technically need more now the thinking in the clan splits in two we get the hunters and we get the bean-counter in the cave and the bean-counter says what we have to do is take those three Buffalo and conserve them preserve them make them last save them so that we get through the winter the hunters see it differently they say no no give us one of the Buffalo to eat and using that strength we will go back out into the field and we will get more Buffalo so that we can make it through the winter all big organizations have this split between the bean-counter and the Buffalo and sometimes it destroys entire companies yeah my belief system says this it doesn't matter how well you save your Buffalo if you don't have enough Buffalo saving effectively is only going to mean you'll starve to death slower you need more Buffalo in the system in other words you need to put 20 percent of your energy into saving your money and 80 percent of your energy into generating more money that's the way we need to think saving is important but it's not all important middle-class thinking says the most important thing to do is save sure if you're going to live for 150 years brilliant idea number eight Randy gage the u.s. speaker recently wrote a book called risky is the new safe the alternative applies safe is the new risky we've been taught for generations to play it safe you get a job and don't make waves I contend that that is the most dangerous thing that you can possibly do because you are taking all of your eggs and putting them in one basket you are taking your life your future your career your spouse your children your medical aids your debit orders your entire life putting them into one basket and handing them to a person whose first concern is not your welfare that sounds pretty dangerous to me also 6070 years ago people did go and get a job and work for 4050 years and retire safely does that happen anymore heck no it's just not the reality most companies these days if you've got a job you have 31 days of safety that's it now let's look at this differently people say being an entrepreneur is risky being your own boss is risky well Forbes magazine says the only people who are wealthy are their own bosses okay the next thing is if you as an entrepreneur try 10 big crazy inspired ideas and eight of them fail you've got two of them working now you go out there and you try another ten big crazy inspired ideas and again eight of them fail two of them work now you're up to four things that are bringing in income you go out there ten big things eight fail two more you're up to six different things that are bringing in income for myself as a speaker I now have multiple income streams I speak I train I sell books I sell DVDs I do media appearances multiple streams of income much much safer risky is the new safe safe is the new risky and the more we buy into the old Industrial Revolution era idea that having a boss take care of us is safe the greater the danger we put our own lives in risky is the new safe safe is the new risky I believe that risk aversion is one of the things that paralyzes most of the people in the middle class your average high net worth individual has been bankrupt three times how scary is the idea of going bankrupt to you yeah to them it's a matter of course they've tried big crazy things they've tried building up businesses and they've uh Turley utterly failed but to them it's only part of the process and they do something interesting and I'd like to invite you to do this they give themselves permission to fail folks today at this early stage in your career make that commitment to yourself do yourself a favor give yourself permission to fail it's okay it's only a bit of embarrassment so any bit of skin off the knees it's only picking yourself up and trying again they think differently in California to what we think here the guy here started and started up a business and failed banks won't touch him with a bargepole in California the banks and the financier seek out the people who have tried and failed before because they reckon that person has learnt valuable lessons along the way give yourself permission to fail here's a revolutionary thought give other people permission to laugh at you and mock you for trying let that be okay say I know my family's not going to understand I know my friends are going to laugh at me they're going to tell me this is crazy you should play it safe and get a job give them permission to think that way give them permission to laugh at you give yourself permission to try and fail you need the space you need the leeway be kind to yourself my final parting thought for today is just this you are not separated from your goals by a number of years you are separated from your goals by a number of actions and that's completely different years years are an abstract concept that's like saying 1020 years from now I'll be wealthy it's not up to years it's up to you and your actions that puts the ball back in your hand that gives you control that gives you the power you are not separated from your goals by a number of years you're separated from your goals by a number of actions the word is as a man thinks so is he so ladies and gentlemen know to think for may god bless you and may you prosper
the internet has been accused of wrecking many things over the years the record industry blockbuster video travel agents road maps empathy civilized debate and porno mags one thing it hasn't killed though is the conspiracy theory in fact the internet is breathing new life into some crazy ideas that have been doing the rounds for centuries well i don't know much about the movement other than i understand they like me very much how cuan and ribs of the oldest conspiracy theory in the world on the face of it q anon is a trump-era conspiracy theory it's basically an ever-expanding web of madness designed to make trump look as if he's fighting a secret global movement of evil child killers from hollywood you are unnoticed q anon is so famous now that even your grand knows about it in fact that's basically the problem your grand loves curing on and so do all her facebook friends but q anon isn't as new as you'd imagine it's basically a version of every old conspiracy theory and at its heart is a thing called the protocols of the elders of zion the most damaging conspiracy theory in history the protocols of the elders of zion is a hundred-year-old book it's a book that was read by hitler and a book that inspired the 9 11 terrorists it is perhaps the most dangerous book ever published a crazy lie that has hung over the head of every single jewish person ever since the book claims to be a real record of a secret meeting in this secret meeting powerful jewish people plot to take over the world secretly start wars manipulate banks and media and form an eternal one world government obviously this is an insane racist fantasy the protocols was proven to be a hoax in 1921 it was most likely the work of the russian empire's secret police looking to whip up support for the tsar by scapegoating a minority in this case jewish people despite the fact that the vast majority of european jews lived in abject poverty the existence of a few wealthy jewish families were spun into conspiracy theories of an insular and self-interested hebrew cabal out to control the world this is all clearly an insane lie unfortunately the world is a very racist place so plenty of people were happy to believe it when the protocols was published it was followed by a wave of violent mob riots that led to thousands of jews being killed and in america henry ford the guy who made ford cars gave away half a million copies for free more recently colonel gaddafi and hamas are among those who've used them to bolster anti-semitic resentment in the middle east and it was even the inspiration for a major egyptian tv series as recently as twenty twelve the lies of the protocol spread so widely that its central idea of a secret evil group ruling the planet is now fairly common it is the center point for many conspiracy theories especially q anon q anon gospel claims that the world is run by the families of hillary clinton who isn't jewish george soros who is and the rothschilds who are as well q says that they run the media control the banks invent wars and want to start a one world government sound familiar safer children but what about q anon's claim that these powerful people also drink the blood of children well child murder isn't directly in the protocols but it is based on a dark lie which goes hand in hand with the protocols blood libel blood libel is the ancient racist myth spread by the christian church that jewish people brutally murder christian children in order to use their blood in religious rituals and this is exactly what q and one claim the clintons in their secret society do as well except in the cue story killing children is about adrenochrome adrenochrome is a mystical chemical that q followers claim flows through children's veins that the evil elites drink to get high actual scientists have never seen massively fussed about adrenochrome but western counter culture has been mythologizing the stuff ever since aldous huxley wrote about it while off his face back in 1954. in a clockwork orange alex and his gang of sociopaths neck pints of milk laced with adrenochrome between bouts of ultra violence and in hunter s thompson's fairer loathing in las vegas the character dr gonzo claims it only works if you get it from the adrenal gland of a living human body there is conspiracies that the coronavirus is a cover-up for what is truly happening right now even over in england they say that the queen has been taking this to outstand and live a longer life and it's said to give you eternal youth during coronavirus lockdown kewanon assumed that many celebrities were looking less glam than usual because the pandemic was cutting off their supply of young blood causing them adrenochrome withdrawal do not let them normalize pedophilia people empower their subjects to fantasize about shadowy elites that don't exist that way they're not questioning the power structures that do well i don't know much about the movement other than i understand they like me very much which i appreciate you are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing i mean you know if if i can help save the world from problems i'm willing to do it i'm willing to put myself out there and we are actually some leaders are so bad so full of lies their followers have had to believe in a legion of secret pedo vampire societies in order to make their leader look like the goodie 
" Giza, Egypt. In 1977 and then again in 1987, electronics engineer and inventor Joe Parr conducted experiments on the top of the Great Pyramid. Using equipment of his own design, Parr measured the pyramid's electrical, magnetic, and radioactive properties. JOHN DESALVO: Joe Parr, who was my very close friend and research colleague, discovered what I believe is the most incredible discovery about the Great Pyramid, and pyramids in general. Joe believed that the pyramids had an energy field around them. All pyramids had it. The problem is the pyramid energy field was usually not strong enough. So he developed in his laboratory a method for generating this pyramid energy so then he could actually do scientific studies on it. PHILIP COPPENS: Over the last few decades, people have been experimenting with pyramids. What has come to the forefront of this is the fact that pyramids are an enigma. They really have powers which are very hard to explain. And so people like Joe Parr have been looking into this. When somebody goes to the top of the Great Pyramid and experiences this weird electromagnetic vibration, this is not just a coincidence. But this has to do with the fact that the Great Pyramid is causing this. JOHN DESALVO: Joe Parr found out that if he put a model pyramid and spun it in the centrifuge through an alternating magnetic current, an energy field, or he calls it in an aura or bubble, would form around the model pyramid. Joe found that this bubble or energy orb would block all types of electromagnetic radiation, even gamma rays. Now, this was interesting. We don't know of any types of energy forces that could do this. This is the most incredible thing about Joe Parr's discovery. In later laboratory experiments, Parr claimed to have discovered yet another strange physical phenomenon. The model pyramid became weightless in the energy field and began to move in a specific direction. JOHN DESALVO: They calculated the direction of this energy field where the pyramid would shoot out from. And guess what? It aligns exactly where we see the constellation Orion. So Joe speculated that it went into hyperspace. This is speculation, but it makes a lot of sense. And string theory in physics-- it postulates the existence of six additional spatial dimensions. So how do we know the way this energy fields were set up, it allows this pyramid to go into another dimension and travel? Joe never proved this. But before he died, he believed that the pyramids act as a time machine if you could unlock its key. I believe that that is the gateway or portal into multiple dimensions that would enable the transmission of people, objects, or consciousness from other dimensions into our dimension. Is it possible, like Joe Parr believed, that the Great Pyramid could facilitate travel through interdimensional space? And if so, were there other pyramids with the same capabilities? Might the Earth's pyramids be connected not simply by shape, but by purpose, perhaps as part of some otherworldly plan? DAVID CHILDRESS: The ancient people were all building these same pyramids because it was a way for them to tap into the natural energy of the Earth. And you have to think that whoever is guiding such a precise network of pyramids must have been a very advanced culture, probably extraterrestrials. GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS: In all of this, I have one single question. Where are the blueprints? If all of this was so incredibly important, then wouldn't you think that we would have at least one record of some type of a blueprint? And the reality is there is not a single piece. Why? Could it be because the blueprints have disappeared? "
so you're the heads of china once one of the greatest empires in the world but in the late 1800s and early 1900s you hit a rough patch china was defeated and pillaged by the british the french japan russia basically china an empire that very much values honor respect was put to shame on the world stage for over a hundred years it was so bad that china would later call it the century of humiliation if that wasn't bad enough china also had a few more rough patches after that with around 18 to 45 million deaths during a movement they called the great leap forward and around another 20 million deaths during the movement after that called the cultural revolution because of all the shame and disgrace you've grown to resent not just the west but the rest of the east the north the south and everyone in between you long for the days when you were number one when you were on top of the world but don't take my word for it take the word from all these chinese officials that regularly spout this china has become a global leader in terms of composite national strength and international influence and the worst part is that you could easily be number one if it wasn't for those milling americans that believe in democracy natural rights and other dangerous ideas like freedom of speech ideas that if your populist gets a whiff of it would be the end of your rule because of these ideas and the fact that america is the only one standing in your way for world domination this automatically makes them public enemy number one throughout human history all the way up to the 1900s to defeat an enemy state you simply go to war but as we've seen with our 100 years of shame traditional warfare hasn't been our strong suit for a while but it is for those despicable americans even though the americans didn't really win in the middle east or vietnam or korea their traditional forces of soldiers tanks and aircraft are a force to be reckoned with while having actual combat experience so you put your pride away and objectively realize that it's far from guaranteed that you could win a head-to-head boots on the ground war with the us we need a new plan of attack a new way to wage war where we don't have to go head first into america's greatest strength and our greatest weakness following our great sun zeus art of war if you're gonna attack your enemy attack him where he can't defend luckily for you times have changed the modern day battlefield is no longer fought with bullets but with ones and zeroes dollars and cents sure there will always be a time for conventional warfare but today instead of storming the desert it's storming the enemy's walls by attracting foreign investors money and not letting that money ever leave your country instead of killing soldiers it's by baiting companies that outsource their workers for dirt cheap labor thereby taking away jobs from the enemy country killing their morale and making them more dependent on you instead of fighting on the european front or the pacific front it's fighting on the economic front the social front instead of deploying troops it's deploying cyber warfare troops that sit behind a computer screen instead of invading and occupying smaller nations it's offering them irresistible loans to build infrastructure projects and taking them over once they can't pay it back war is no longer using force to compel your enemy to your will but rather by using all means armed and unarmed force lethal and non-lethal force by doing whatever it takes and you want to know what the best part is is that while all these revolutionary changes are happening to the battlefield your arch nemesis the u.s are still spending away all their resources building up their conventional forces thinking that they have the most powerful military leaving them with no resources are desired to invest into the real domains the cyber and economic ones but can you really blame them the traditional military industrial complex and defense contracts make a lot of money so lucky for us why would they want to change that's not our job the us military leaders say so like everything else their government does they keep kicking the can down the road like sun tzu said if your opponent doesn't even know they're at war well they've already lost this is that strategy we're at war only it's not being fought by guns and missiles not yet at least it's a war of perception the greatest long-term threat to our nation's information and intellectual property and to our economic vitality is the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat from china that i think it's the most consequential existential threat not just to america just to democracy the world's ever seen but if you think these issues are just an intelligence issue or a government problem or a nuisance largely just for big corporations who can largely take care of themselves you could not be more wrong it's the people of the united states who are the victims of what amounts to chinese theft on a scale so massive that it represents one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history war combat it's all about deception you make the enemy think you're gonna come out from one corner to shoot but then boom you come out of the other corner and blow them to bits the modern battlefield is no different you make the west believe that you support free trade and globalization while systematically taking advantage of it you tell other countries like the us to say no to protectionism to tariffs well that's literally your entire strategy you waive the carrot of short-term profits in front of your enemies that are drooling at the mouth while using their money to fund your rise to number one china has a fundamentally different system than ours and it's doing all it can to exploit the openness of ours while taking advantage of its own closed system and at the core china's main strategy and advantage over the us is just that the ability to think in decades and centuries instead of quarterly earnings reports or the next election cycle china has a vision a big why a purpose to guide them through all the short-term pain in their journey to world domination with absolute power over their subjects to back it up the u.s on the other hand have grown weak and comfortable from nearly a hundred years of opulence and much like how a spoiled child can never work hard america's prosperity and freedom will be its own downfall they're not willing to give up their comforts to fight a bigger enemy and their government has hardly any control over their own citizens think of china kinda like the old robber barons like rockefeller or jp morgan but at a global level we can use every single dirty trick in the book to crush our competitors the chinese government is engaged in a broad diverse campaign of theft and malign influence and it can execute that campaign with authoritarian efficiency they're calculating they're persistent they're patient and they're not subject to the righteous constraints of an open democratic society or the rule of law every war has different fronts that must be fought in world war ii it was the european front and the asia pacific front for this new cold war there are many different fronts where one of the most important being the economic front china saw how money turned the u.s into a global superpower and how micromanaging everything destroyed the soviet union so china took the best of both worlds they combined the absolute authoritarianism they needed to stay in power but sprinkled on some capitalism to make the money they would need to dominate the world or in other words we realize that money talks on the global stage so we align private profit with national interests china has complete control over the economy so we can do whatever it takes to make sure the right companies succeed in the direction we want and yet we've created one of the freest environments to do business there's no pesky things like the epa better business bureau intellectual property rights and yet the government has the final say on all matters if they think your company is better suited merged with this other company they'll take your company and assets by force and merge it with the other an awful lot of large chinese businesses are state-owned enterprises literally owned by the government and thus the party and even if they aren't china's laws allow its government to compel any chinese company to provide any information it requests including american citizens data on top of that chinese companies of any real size are legally required to have communist party cells inside them to keep them in line the equivalent to the us government forcing apple to have a u.s representative on their board of directors to make sure everything is going according to plan competition among chinese is extremely dog-eat-dog and yet important companies get cash injections and are backed by the government because of this close economy we're able to pull off some very clever tricks that get us ever so closer to world domination one of our greatest tactics is the fact that when foreign investors put money into our country no matter how much money they earn on paper they can never pull it out of the here's how it works number one we attract foreign businesses investors banks hedge funds many of them from the us to invest billions upon billions of dollars over the years into chinese real estate businesses stocks which is not very hard given that we have the biggest population and the biggest new market to make money in number two the investors money is used to make our economy the fastest growing in history while preventing that same money from being used to grow america's economy number three the investors see their money grow on paper which makes them really happy and attracts more investors and number four when investors want to take their earnings out and convert it into let's say usd they can't why because this is our closed economy you have to follow our rules if you want to play and our rule is is that we need this money to stay within our borders to keep funding our astronomical growth as long as more money keeps coming into china unless it's going out all is going according to plan sure with the right person applying the right pressure money can go out of china but for the average foreign firm like chevron sony x on these suckers have had their money trapped here since 2015. now if you're sitting there with your hands stroking your chin wondering this this kind of sounds like a ponzi scheme where investors put money in and their money is used as returns for the investor that came in before them no well i'll let you guys be the judge of that and if you think that trick was clever you have seen nothing yet see every country's currency's value is determined by traders on foreign exchange markets but who says that's how it has to work if we put our un on the market we'd completely lose control over it so the un isn't traded on foreign exchange markets everything happens within our borders its value is whatever we say it is china has printed 30 trillion dollars worth of rmb in a decade like the scale to which they've printed is again it's unprecedented can the chinese run their stock market up absolutely domestically they control the price they control the printing press they control the police they control the narrative and there are many other tricks up our sleeves forcing foreign companies to give up the trade secrets to do business in china when no other nations do that to chinese firms stealing anywhere from two to three trillion dollars worth of intellectual property from the us over the past 10 years and selling it back to them at a discount they all estimate that that number's 200 to 300 billion dollars worth of ip per year there's a return on that annually as well so over the last decade they've stolen you know two to three trillion uh in ip from us we've now reached the point where the fbi is opening a new china-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours of the nearly 5 000 active fbi counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country almost half are all related to china not allowing western social platforms like google facebook youtube and our economy so we can control the narrative while the west allows all of our government-controlled social platforms into their nation so we can influence their narrative getting us companies to outsource 3.7 million manufacturing jobs to our very poor cheap laborers since 2001 pummeling their middle class even more forcing u.s companies not to spread ideas we don't like like disney hollywood the nba marriott and more all this economic warfare is for one purpose to fund our meteoric rise as the fastest growing economy in history with everyone else's money while fooling everyone into thinking that we're playing by the worlds and that yes you should definitely keep treating us fairly even though we're not treating you fairly and all this economic power allows us to move on to the other fronts of this new cold war like the all too insidious infrastructure fronts infrastructure is one of the most important aspects of a society it is literally the underlying foundation of a country infrastructure also happens to be one of those things that is taken for granted by the populace people in the u.s typically don't go about their dates wondering hey how secure are gas pipelines or electricity grids or who controls the shipping ports and container ships where 90 of our goods travel on yet if just one of these systems went out it would lead to some catastrophic events that's why in china we understand just how important infrastructure warfare is in our ever more connected world that's why we have a laser focused on infrastructure both domestically and internationally within china we're focused on making our economy completely independent from the outside world where we're not dependent on exports or imports an economy that isn't fragile to the goodwill of others like how every nation including china is right now this is where ghost cities come into play to create this insulated economy china started building entire cities 120 in total each designed to hold between 5 to 10 million people that's why in just two years from 2012 to 2014 china poured more concrete than the us did in the last 100 years because these cities were built ahead of demand there are 50 ghost cities in china 50 cities ranging from twice the size of philadelphia to the size of new york without a soul to be seen and guess what china's plan for an independent super economy was funded by you guessed it the west headed by wall street who probably aren't going to get their money back and every cent of this construction went straight into china's record-breaking gdp numbers so that begs the question if there are 64 million vacant apartments on the market and even more vacant business space in the billions of square feet it would only make sense that real estate prices should have already crashed in china right well no as we learn in the economic front china controls the entire economy including real estate and prices so we simply prevent this new real estate from being sold see what westerners don't understand is that economic growth is very easy if you control everything while we're making our infrastructure more robust at home naturally we're focused on making everyone else's infrastructure more fragile abroad this is where the belt and road initiative or bri comes in a plan to connect nearly 70 nations many of them poor desperate emerging nations around the world by road rail air and most importantly by sea and here's how it works number one find nations with resources we need whether that be cheap labor mined or important locations number two approach these desperate nations with a smile and say that in the name of facilitating free trade and harmony peace and prosperity we'll give you a loan that we know you can't pay back to build infrastructure projects like a seaport to build up your economy and will just collect interest in return a no-brainer deal you'd be crazy to pass it up and then boom step number three once you drown the country in debt it's basically yours and from here you can do whatever you want in the case of the very strategic port of sri lanka when they couldn't make the payments they just gave it back to china with even more land on top of that in the case of africa you can keep milking the resources and cementing your influence and control as these nations start to prosper you can sell to them collect their data and further your influence and all these locations that are practically ours are more avenues for us to send conventional military troops through if that time ever comes more on that later if you want to learn more about this modern day colonialism check out our video called the profitable business of enslaving third world countries along with domestic infrastructure and the bri the last and most important piece of the infrastructure front is 5g now if you're looking for 5g conspiracy theories go watch some other video because we don't even have to go into that kind of speculation 5g is not just another phone network sure it gives consumers up to 100 times faster speed but for the most part consumers won't be able to take advantage of all that extra juice the real game changer is that this extra speed and bandwidth will make way for a new generation of society built around devices connected to each other whereas 4g only allows around 6 500 devices per square mile 5g can support up to a million devices per square mile this extra capacity means that every aspect of a society's infrastructure planes trains machinery self-driving cars smart homes connected healthcare agriculture cameras the military will be able to communicate with each other over a 5g network more data being collected means that more data can be funneled into ai and machine learning algorithms at an even faster rate and if you thought technology was already moving fast if the highway data travels on gets supercharged the pace of technology will increase at an even more incomprehensible rates we already talked about how fragile nations are to the infrastructure so if the future of infrastructure is powered over 5g networks if one were to control said 5g networks one could theoretically have the keys not to just the kingdom but to the entire modern world including all of one's enemies in our modern world there is perhaps no more ominous prospect than a hostile foreign government's ability to compromise our country's infrastructures and devices if one controlled all 5g networks one could theoretically view all the world's data traveling on those super highways including business plans military plans academic papers engineering plans surveillance camera feeds anything and everything sent over 5g one could also turn off aspects of a nation's infrastructure at will one could collect and feed everyone's data into one's own ai algorithms like one is already doing with the government controlled social media platforms or in other words if china is gonna get back to its glory days on the world stage it would be very advantageous of us to take the same approach we're doing with the belt and road initiative generously offered to build a 5g networks for other nations out of our own goodwill of course but you gotta keep this part extra secret because other countries are starting to catch on to our intentions like japan australia and the uk india those middling americans of course and maybe even the eu if we don't act fast if chinese companies like huawei are given unfettered access to our telecommunications infrastructure they could collect any of your information that traverses their devices or networks worse still they'd have no choice but to hand it over to the chinese government if asked the privacy and due process protections that are sacrosanct in the united states are simply non-existent in china there are many other fronts in this new cold war that we don't have time to get into the cyber warfare front the technology front the social front but there's one more friend worth mentioning an under the radar return to the conventional military fronts as we mentioned in the beginning of this video as long as we're not guaranteed to win the conventional war with the us we'll keep fighting on the more subtle modern day battlefield but china isn't dumb we know that conventional warfare will never go away and that someday we might just have to participate in it and as the west has been funding our rise we've been investing a lot of that money not just a normal infrastructure like we already talked about but also into our military so if or when that time ever comes we can strike china already has more warships than the u.s navy while the u.s has been lowering its icbm count due to international agreements we've been stockpiling hours and regularly show them off and a healthy amount of us military components and raw materials come straight from china the propellant that fires their missiles materials for their night vision goggles their entire telecom system their computers they're entirely dependent on us so for now we'll just keep selling war materials to the americans build up our own power and control and then strike if the time comes so you know that war is all about deception not just conventional fighting you know about our economic front the business front all the different infrastructure fronts at home and abroad and how we're gearing up our conventional fronts so the question remains who's gonna win this new cold war well if the west keeps fighting each other about systematic racism while the concept of racial discrimination doesn't even exist in china with this very own concentration camps and cattle cars mind you if the west keeps calling a certain president a tyrant when there's an actual authoritarian regime a few thousand miles off the coast of california that makes the certain president look like gandhi if consumers keep buying chinese plastic just to save a buck well they better start learning mandarin and let's just calm down and put this okay confronting this threat effectively does not mean we shouldn't do business with the chinese does not mean we shouldn't host chinese visitors it does not mean we shouldn't welcome chinese students or co-exist with china on the world stage but it does mean that when china violates our criminal laws and international norms we are not going to tolerate it much less enable it the fbi and our partners throughout the u.s government will hold china accountable and protect our nation's innovation ideas and way of life with the help and vigilance of the american people thank you for having me here today speaking of learning mandarin check out today's video sponsor um i mean we don't have a sponsor because not many brands are willing to support this video economic warfare at its finest so i tell you what if you want to support this channel financially and you want more videos like this one check out a course i made on how to land a remote job this is how i got my start and this whole make money online thing with a 40 per hour remote web dev job and i believe it's the most practical way for others to get started as well you don't have to start a business from scratch you learn valuable skills on your own time while making consistent money so you're not starving to death and as we've seen in recent times remote jobs are a lot less fragile than traditional ones and my favorite part is that you can use remote jobs as a jumping off point for whatever you want you can use the extra time to work on a side business like i did or you can be a digital nomad traveling the world which a lot of people do with their remote jobs as well and with this course it walks you through what jobs to go after based on your personality what the best route to learn it are standing out when applying to jobs and interviews and basically everything you need from start to finish and you can start your remote journey right now for a very reasonable price and support this channel at the same time with the link below gentle reminder that i have partnered up with the chinese communist party and for every single time you guys watch a video leave a comment leave a like subscribe turn on the notification bell your social credit score will go up by one point so get that social credit score up before you get thrown into a concentration camp i mean a re-education gap nobody here is a criminal no sir okay gentlemen sorry we couldn't work anything out but uh i'm gonna go home and pay my taxes highly highly recommend you guys read the book that this video is based on called stuff for how china took over while america's elite slept by brigader general robert spalding from what i understand brigader general is like one of the highest ranks in the military so this guy he knows what he's talking about it's not that long or a hard read and it goes over like a ton of stuff that i didn't have time to cover in this video also i see you guys backing me up in the warzone that is the comment section this is turning out to be like a real mafia where you like defend the godfather so you know don tran really appreciates it and i want you to know that i see you and i really appreciate

read anywhere else included is hidden video footage of the man who won a Nobel Prize for discovering HIV claiming openly that HIV is harmless to most people his own words I'm about to expose to you the fraud of HIV testing and how unsuspecting people in Africa who know nothing about human biology or the nature of HIV tests are being deceived and drugged to death by the antiretroviral poisons being fed to them by large pharmaceutical corporations and the criminal individuals who are gaining financially by maintaining the rules let's start by defining AIDS what is AIDS AIDS is an acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids is a weakened immune system that is what aids is now what causes AIDS any number of things if you happen to have multiple bacterial or viral infections or one serious bacterial infection you could end up with AIDS because your immune system could be stressed beyond what it can handle also if your immune system is weak due to malnutrition you would have AIDS yes this means there are millions of people in the world with AIDS without HIV in fact HIV AIDS is a misnomer because as I'm about to uncover for you HIV does not cause AIDS despite what you've been told so you know AIDS is the weakening of the body's immune system by disease or malnutrition now Morrow nutrition is something from which many people in Africa it just so happened to suffer that we have known what causes acquired immune deficiency diseases for at least 70 years it's in the medical textbooks it's there for you to read number one cause on the face of this earth is malnutrition and starvation that's Africa look to the headlines of the October 3rd issue of the London Times Sunday Times last year and the inside headlines it screamed across two pages the plague that never was speak to Philip and Evelyn crimen who had part Taj with an organization of 250 people their own Hospital their own doctors their own laboratories who have lived in the heart of the epidemic supposed to think or the supposed at epidemic for five years there is no epidemic it doesn't exist they are there they're not some character who goes through from the World Health Organization and says oh I've seen the people dying of course you have we all saw them on television in Somalia what do you think you were looking at that was AIDS due to starvation due to malnutrition so they essentially redefine malnutrition as aids in Africa because you don't need an HIV test and so the millions of people in Africa we're told you have this fatal disease and the only cure for it it's not clean water nutritious food all those other things that many Africans do not have it's toxic expensive drugs from the rich country when the hiv/aids craze was first being propagandized by the media worldwide millions upon millions of Africans were fraudulently diagnosed with hiv/aids and prescribed toxic pharmaceutical chemicals intentionally designed to kill them these were malnourished people who quite accurately could be described as having AIDS because they did have AIDS something which had nothing to do with HIV however they were being misled to believe that the drugs men to treat HIV could also treat AIDS because HIV AIDS that was the pharmaceutical companies propagandizing through the mainstream media and the World Health the hiv/aids drugs primarily ezt being given to people are killing them did you know that there is a 100% death rate by immune deficiency amongst each and every single person who takes the HIV AIDS antiretroviral drugs 100% death rate did you know however that each and every single person who has ever refused to take the hiv/aids drugs has lived a healthy life none who refused the drugs died of immune deficiency related causes none whether they are diagnosed with HIV or not I remember in 1992 after I first tested positive I became involved in an organization called women at risk there were 11 of us at the time on the board and involved in the group all of us except three were on the medications in the year and a half that I was involved with women at risk every single woman in that organization on the drugs died every single one except the three of us who weren't taking them a Z T is highly mutagenic meaning that it destroys the genes and cells and has been shown to cause cancer in rodents it targets the bone marrow where B lymphocyte blood cells are being made these are the very cells an AIDS patient needs most for immunity a Z T destroys randomly bone marrow kidneys liver intestines muscle tissue the brain and central nervous system Peter Duesberg claims AZT actually causes AIDS itself ezt deaths does directly causing AIDS and defining diseases you know it says a lot of things but it doesn't cause Kaposi sarcoma I think but it does cause immunodeficiency it was designed to do that it was designed to kill human cells in fact the manufacturer says that specifically that it can cause each like diseases in the manufacturer that is spirits welcomed says it is often difficult to distinguish adverse events possibly associated with sido ruling on Sedova Dean Administration which is a CT from underlying science of HIV disease in other words even they acknowledge nothing just respect that CDV that ECT causes AIDS or insta finding diseases the hiv/aids drugs are the cause of AIDS and when given to anyone who already has AIDS and accelerated death is all it offers when given to healthy people the result is the same it terminates life you terminate DNA you terminate life and they talk about side effects in the insert when are you gonna learn there is no such thing as a side effect in medicine it's an unwanted direct effect and you know what one of the unwanted direct effects of AZT is lymphoma cancer one of the diseases of AIDS as they call it oh so called side effect which is really an unwanted direct effect pan cytokine iya you need a definition pancytopenia pan all Saito's cells pina loss of loss of all your cells that's AIDS that is the definition of AIDS so AZT by definition by their own drug insert causes AIDS and nobody survives AZT that will eventually lead to your death and they've cut the dosage way down because it was killing them too fast it's like giving somebody a large dose of strychnine and they die within 5 minutes and so the next person you give them as a few drops of it and they last 4 or 5 days and you say strychnine is a wonderful drug this person last five times longer the mass poisonings of unsuspecting Africans were going on in Africa behind everyone else's backs in the West while people in the West were being told that Africans had hiv/aids the propagandists needed to continuously fraudulently mention HIV and AIDS together to create a false link between those words and justify their proclamations of an AIDS epidemic in Africa one wish they manufactured entirely there is not a single scientific paper which claims categorically that HIV causes AIDS not a single reference anyway in the scientific literature because HIV does not cause aids to claim in a scientific paper that HIV causes AIDS could easily incur lawsuits when the aforementioned statement is proven to be false because it is false however the media keeps saying HIV causes AIDS and people write articles claiming HIV causes AIDS but none of them can give you a reference to the scientific literature which asserts that statement as fact all you will find is other deceptive propaganda pieces written under the guise of someone's opinion but written deceptively to defraud laypeople the first time I really questioned it I was working on a project where we were measuring HIV in people's blood at this place called specialty laboratories in Santa Monica I was just in a consultant there and I came in about three days a month and we were working on that and at some point we needed to re-up our grant from the NIH to work on that and I had to write it and so the first line of that was HIV is the probable cause of AIDS I wrote that and then I said well I need a paper some kind of scientific paper to reference that statement cuz when you make a sign to a statement like that's like a fact so you need to say here's how come I know that all right you put a little one if it's the first statement you've made and then you put down at the bottom the paper you have a 1 you say here's a paper by somebody that describes why that statement is true all right and so I said that's well what's that I don't know man think about what is that paper who do I go to for that and I looked around I asked a couple of our ologists that company and they said no you know I took reference I thought I have to reference that because I don't know I don't know where that came from how do I know that and it turned out that nobody knew it there wasn't a scientific reference like a a paper that somebody has submitted with like experimental data in it and like logical discussion and said here's how come we know that HIV is the probable cause of AIDS there's nothing left there like that nothing we've talked about AIDS and the fact that HIV does not cause it but let's talk about HIV is HIV HIV is a supposed retrovirus supposedly discovered by Robert Gallo and Luc Montaigne interesting the HIV according to the people who claimed to have discovered it is harmless to most people we can be exposed to HIV many times without being chronically infected our immune system greedy a fatal virus within a few weeks if you have a good image system if you have a good immune system then your body can naturally get rid of HIV yes if you take a poor African who's been infected and you build up the immune system is it possible for them to also naturally get rid of it I would think so that's an important that's an important it's important knowledge which is completely negated you know people always think of drugs and vaccine so this semester which may be different from the there but you were before no no no they yes my message is different from what you had from Fiji oh yes so HIV does not cause AIDS and as revealed by the man who discovered it himself HIV is harmless to most people but how is HIV even tested well there are a number of ways and none of these tests work you because of these different criteria that apply in different countries you couldn't be considered you can test hiv-positive in one country and be given an AIDS diagnosis as a result of that whereas in another country you won't test hiv-positive and you won't be given an AIDS diagnosis it's ludicrous that you can be positive in one country and not positive in another theoretically I could be diagnosed with AIDS in the United States but if I take three steps to my right I wouldn't be diagnosed with AIDS or I would lose my AIDS diagnosis when I cross the border 30,000 Russians who tested positive for HIV were then tested with another test that's supposedly far more accurate to confirm the positivity and 66 out of 30,000 prove to be positive that means that the test HIV is 99.997% inaccurate you want to take a test that's three thousandth of a percent right and you're gonna rely on that but that's what they're doing to people out there they're taking a test that is not only invalid it's totally misleading in fact when you get results like that then I would say you're going to be more correct that if your red is being negative consider yourself positive and if you're positive consider yourself negative by the way at the request of many individuals I did go for a test a couple of weeks ago in New York City at the biggest clinic there that does more testing than anybody else and the doctor who ran it was bragging about the fact that he did more when I told him about the book I wrote he said don't say anything my patients might hear in the scientific paper luc montagnier rob gallo and his associates wrote they claim that HIV might be the cause of AIDS however the HIV AIDS propagandists used the media to make false reports that HIV did in fact cause AIDS even though there was no scientific evidence for that and there were no scientific claims of that thus allowed criminals like Rob gallo and his associates to spread the HIV AIDS line through the media and brainwashed society without being held accountable lawsuit not that the general public knew anything about HIV to sue anyone but in case they did Gallo and his scumbag friends could say we never said HIV causes AIDS the media did interestingly rob Gallo in the scientific paper in which he took part did in fact initially say that HIV causes AIDS he was subsequently found guilty of fraud for making that statement because that statement was false and devoid of any scientific evidence whatsoever additionally he was found guilty of misconduct for lying about and misrepresenting his peers before fraudulently involving himself with hiv/aids rob Gallo had been involved in cancer research where he ridiculously attempted to prove that the cause of cancer was a retrovirus naturally his research yielded no results and was a monumental failure none of the viruses he studied could be linked to cancer however when aids started to become sensationalized by the media for its apparently pervasive existence amongst homosexual men Gallo would later seize upon the opportunity to clear many media announced meant with no scientific evidence whatsoever by the way that a variant of one of the cancer-causing viruses he was researching was the cause of AIDS it was from there that the attention-seeking Rob gallo would make a false name for himself for discovering HIV he went from the unsubstantiated claim that cancer was caused by a retrovirus to the unsubstantiated claim that a variant of the non-existent cancer-causing virus was the cause of AIDS additionally this virus is one which he frozen t claimed to be his discovery when in fact he blatantly stole it from team of French scientists of whom Luc montagnier the now co-discoverer of the retrovirus was a member writing the world wind of public demand Gallo made his move on April 23rd 1984 Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret heckler and Robert gallo called a press conference together that would involve the United States Department of Health and what critics claimed would become the biggest medical scientific blunder of all time first the probable cause of AIDS has been found variant of a known human cancer virus called h LT htlv III with htlv 3 gallows white elephant virus program made the jump from the cause of cancer to become the cause of AIDS and that target of billions of dollars in research funds simultaneously as the press conference was going on the blood test used to detect HIV was being patented which would earn the US Department of Health over a hundred million dollars a year and large financial kickbacks to Robert gallo the AIDS industry was born and the US government was now fully invested naively secretary heckler predicted that a vaccine would be ready for testing by 1986 we hope to have such a vaccine ready for testing in approximately two years for the moment everyone was happy about this discovery of the probable cause of AIDS gay activists were satisfied that the government was finally doing something but the public was not aware that Gallo had bypassed a major checkpoint before making his announcement he had not submitted his test results to other scientists for peer-review no one had a chance to critique or verify his claim and his test results were not published in science magazine until one week after the press conference this was a dangerous violation of scientific protocol suddenly a challenge to gallows ethics emerged which would become an international scandal the institut pasteur ER in paris claimed that Gallo's aids virus was identical to La Vie a virus dr. Luke Montaigne had sent gallows lab six months before the press conference the French were outraged and filed an international lawsuit against the US Health Department on grounds that Gallo had pirated their discovery the entire incident was embarrassing to the United States and had to be resolved diplomatically by President Reagan and prime ministers Jacques Chirac of France it is only because the French government saw the massive potential to make money from the so-called HIV virus that they refrained from suing the United States alongside Gallo and convinced Luc Montaner to join Gallo as a co-discoverer of HIV with this arrangement to split the profits made on the HIV blood test the virus was given a new international name the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV despite questions of Gallo's character and ethics HIV had now gained international acceptance Rob Gallo the man who claims to discover the HIV virus is known fraud a failed scientist a thief and a known liar let that sink in for a second there is not a single scientific document which claims HIV causes any serious disease whatsoever none in fact Kary Mullis the very man who is responsible for inventing the HIV test has admitted there is no body of evidence that supports the claim that HIV causes any disease whatsoever HIV is a lie but what about the individuals who have perpetrated this lie they are all multimillionaires they have made huge investments in this theory their careers their papers their students their academic standing and not the least of it they're huge commercial interests all of almost all of my peers on the right side of the hypothesis on the other side of the other with the right hypothesis have huge commercial conflicts of interest that are not a quarter carefully not mentioned by the press of the journals they have stocks in those welcome they have stocks see it's not an accident that these campuses like ours are surrounded by biotechnology companies Chiron and Genentech like metastasis like a tumor by metastasis they go there and they have their stocks there and they triple the income if that is enough so they pay their their huge homes on the hill their Porsches their Carreras the mistresses what have you that comes all from so these are all investments that are based on their professional on their science on their professional investments "
all right we're out on race today so please bear with gunfire here in the background today we're talking about the 10 millimeter Auto sum of its pluses and minuses and specifically how does it stack up next to a 45 ACP well there's a lot of different handguns available in both calibers so to account for as many extraneous variables as possible the guns I'm going to use are the Glock model 21 and caliber 45 acp and the Glock model 20 in ten millimeter these two handguns are of extremely similar size and weight and the only significant difference being the caliber now before I go any farther I want to say that a lot of people have asked to see a presentation on the 10 millimeter and because of donations to the patreon account I was able to purchase this 10 millimeter so thank you everybody so let's shoot the 10 mu meters side-by-side with the 45 and see how they compare and see if the pluses of the 10 outweigh the minuses the 10 millimeter has a reputation for being very powerful is it well let's see if we can shed some light on that got the chronograph set up at 7 yards and I'm going to start by shooting the 45 now I've got this loaded with Remington green and white locks 45 ACP 185 grain metal case Remington calls it metal case I'll see what kind of velocities I get with the 45 and then see how the 10 millimeter compares 1029 1024 1015 1022 and 968 now let's see how the 10-millimeter compares now I've got the 10 millimeter loaded with Remington green and white box 10 millimeters 180 brain metal case so let's see how we do 1115 1112 1109 1104 1121 now let's go crunch the numbers our 45 ACP has a 185 grain bullet and the 10 millimeter has a 185 grains difference I think we can live with the mean velocity of the 45 is 1011 while with the 10 millimeter is 1112 a net gain of 101 feet per second I'd say that's significantly more but this stuff is targeting ammunition how about some serious carry ammunition well I've got Sig Sauer elite performance and again our 45 is a 185 grain bullet and our 10 millimeter is 180 let's see how these compare and with our elite performance a mo will again start with a 45 1005 1035 1012 998 1036 now let's see how that comparison 10-millimeter and now we'll try the elite performance 10-millimeter 1230 1202 1220 1231 1243 let's go crunch those numbers now with our elite performance animation 45 ACP has a 185 grain jacketed hollow point and we've got a mean velocity of 1017 feet per second that's not that but with our 10 millimeter and it's 180 grain jacketed hollow point we're going to mean velocity of 1225 that's two hundred and eight feet per second more than the 45 ACP so to the question is the 10 millimeter powerful yes is it more powerful than a 45 yes significantly so but that also brings up the question will that greater power give you greater recoil yes I could feel more recoil but to what degree will that greater recoil negatively affect accuracy especially if you're trying to shoot multiple targets quickly well let's see if we can put that to the test now I've got 9 knock down plates set up at 7 yards I'll shoot 1 through 9 do a magazine change during which 1 through 6 will come back up and then I'll shoot them for a total of 15 shots and I'll start with the 45 then I'll repeat that with the 10 millimeter and we'll see to what degree does it's greater recoil slow me down now let's see how that compares to the 10 and now let's try the 10 any difference and if so was it enough to matter now we'll get back to shooting in a few minutes but right now fair warning this is the boring part of the presentation where I talk and what I want to talk about is that when you have a discussion of the 10 millimeter it seems inextricably linked to a discussion of the case of the late Harald fish now I've done some research on this and it comes with the normal caveats the source materials don't always agree with each other and I'm trying to give you the very short version of a very long story but basically it goes like this Harald fish lived in Arizona he went out for a day hike in the woods news carrying a ten millimeter pistol at the end of his hike when you return to his vehicle he was so he claimed accosted by two dogs he fired a warning shot into the ground and that solved his dog problem but he was then charged by the man who was with the dogs he was forced to shoot in self-defense hitting his assailant three times in the chest mortally wounding him fish rendered first-aid saw help the paramedics and the police arrived this made a statement to the police well shortly thereafter under some political and social pressure the district attorney decided to charge fish with second-degree murder fish was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to ten years in prison he served three years after which his conviction was overturned and his case led to some changes in Arizona law now again I'm giving you the very short version of this one of those changes was it shifted the burden of proof away from a citizen having to prove their claim of self-defense was legitimate to the state having to prove that claim wasn't legitimate and that's the way that criminal prosecutions are supposed to work now there are a lot of people who will posit the opinion that Harold Fisk was fraudulently charged for the crime well I wasn't there but based on what I could learn about this that is an opinion I would tend to agree with however there's also people who will say that he was fraudulently charged based solely on the fact that he had a 10-millimeter and that's just not correct there was a lot more stuff involved in it than that such as he had given some conflicting reports of what happened and some of the things he said were contradictory to what other people had said for example he said this happened at 6:30 while someone who was some distance away but heard the gunfire said that it happened at 5:30 there was also the fact that the coroner or medical examiner gave some very damning testimony and among that was he testified that of the shots that entered the thoracic cavity Warren had already passed through the decedent's hand I don't know where and that that definitively showed that the decedent was in a surrender position not an attack position also the angle of the wound channels showed that the decedent was standing still not coming forward as fissioned claimed well I didn't see the autopsy report but I find assertions like that that something proves that someone's in a defensive position not just getting ready to hit you with with an open hand or any defensive position not coming at you to strangle you or that someone was standing still not moving forward I find conclusions like that to be dubious at best now in looking at all of this and again I haven't seen all the information but based on what I do know I'm of the opinion that it is very unlikely that fish committed a crime at all and because he didn't commit a crime there is very little evidence to show that he did and so a district attorney under some political and social pressure to get a conviction to bootstrap a very weak case and he did that in several ways among that was trying to exclude what many people would consider very important exploratory evidence for example there were several people ready to testify that the decedent in this case had been aggressive and combative and violent on previous occasions but he accosted several people but the district attorney successfully petitioned the court to exclude that evidence and so the jury didn't get to hear a lot of that now what this has to do with a 10-millimeter is another thing the district attorney did was he tried to vilify fish for having a ten millimeter pistol saying that this pistol was more powerful than what the police had and because it was loaded with hollow-point ammunition that demonstrated that fish was violent and obviously wanted to kill somebody okay so what can we take away from all of this well a few things one of which is in cases like this the people whose job it is to investigate these things such as the police and the people whose job it is to decide whether or not you're going to be prosecuted and then prosecute you in like the District Attorney's Office those people approach these investigations with their education their experience their knowledge their wisdom but they are human beings and sometimes they can also bring with them their lack of experience their ignorance their prejudices their bigotries and sometimes their political agendas and quite often things that absolutely should not matter end up mattering things like did you shave that day what were you wearing and your choice of firearms and ammunition and anybody who's ever been the victim of gender bias or racial bigotry knows exactly what I'm talking about but specifically about a ten millimeter there's a couple of things we can take away from this two of those being one if you own a 10-millimeter or you're planning on buying one I would really recommend that you appoint yourself with the details of the case of the late Harold fish because if you're discussing a 10-millimeter it's very likely his name is going to come up another thing is if you are in the process of deciding whether or not you want to buy a 10-millimeter you should make that decision based on are you buying a good quality firearm does it fit your hand does it fit your needs does it fit your budget and the list goes on but there are a large number of people out there who are for lack of a better term bigoted against the ten millimeter and that's something I think you should take into consideration too so all that having been said let's get back to shooting now here's some 3a body armor and here is you we know 3a body armor will stop the projectiles from calibers like 9 by 1947 Wesson 45 ACP when those are fired from what would be considered stereotypical hands on length barrels but what about a 10 millimeter well I've got my 10 millimeters loaded with four rounds two of the Remington green and white box 180 grain metal case and two of the Sig Sauer elite performance 180 grain jacketed hollow-point and I'll shoot this from seven yards and we'll see what happens now a lot of times even if this body armor stops the bullet there's enough concussion to crack that soda bottle so if you see soda leaking reserve judgment until after we do the neck rocks the body armor did stop the bullet but there was enough concussion that it chewed up this one soda bottle pretty badly so I'll set this up again with a higher quality duct tape and then let's see what happens well three things one it stopped the bullet too even if the three a body armor can stop the bullet it looks like the 10 millimeter can still do a lot of damage and three it looks like this advanced level duct tape wasn't quite as advanced as I'd hoped for let's try one more shot and here's the three shots we fired our two hollow points in our one metal case round so in the contest of three a body armor versus 10 millimeter pistol I've got to declare the three a body armor the winner marginally now this is the point in the presentation a lot of you have been waiting for where we shoot the meat target in fact I'm going to bet some of you have fast forwarded to this part but in shooting the meat target with a 10 millimeter we have to approach that differently than we would with other handgun calibers because a lot of people not only have a 10 for home defense or something like that but they carry a 10 millimeter in the field for protection against lions tigers bears oh my and so we had to come up with a meat target that would be representative of that now if you were being attacked by an animal as it's coming toward you you'd probably shoot it in the front but in a lot of hunting scenarios it's very typical to shoot a lateral thoracic shot that you want to pass through both lungs so the meat target we have today is our double lung meat target and we've got ribs on both sides but their beef ribs not pork ribs beef ribs are a lot more robust than pork we do have our pig ear skin and then over that our leather jacket skin this animal has a thick hide and behind that as always the high tech police bullet stop now there's two questions we want to answer one is the 10 millimeter going to be effective and the other is is it really going to be significantly more effective than 45 ACP well we'll start with the 45 and I've got it loaded with the Sig Sauer elite performance 185 grain jacketed hollow-point so I'll shoot from 7 yards and we'll see what happens effective I'd say so bullets went through the ribs where they hit the ribs broke them pulverized our lung tissue but we see a big loss in energy our second watermelon lung doesn't have near as much damage and all of the projectiles were stopped by the ribs on the back they didn't even penetrate the plastic wrap the ribs come in a couple of the projectiles lost their jacket one of those jackets was stuck in this second watermelon now let me show you a close-up of them here's a couple of projectiles that hit the ribs and they're just mangled here's the jacket one of them one stayed intact and the expansion looks really good now we'll try the ten millimeter with the Sig Sauer relief performance 180 grain jacket effective again I'd say yes first let me show you a close-up of the bullets so like the 45 hour 10 millimeter bullets are mangled one lost its jacket and the jacket was stuck in the second water going and one stayed intact and expanded very well so our 10 millimeter projectiles went through the ribs on the front where they hit a rib shattered it destroyed our first watermelon we see greater retention of energy than the 45 had and more damage to our second watermelon but still all the projectiles were stopped by the ribs on the fact they were just barely stuck in there so it was the 45 effective yes was the 10 millimeter more so yeah maybe a little bit but let me show you one other thing now I'm going to shoot the meat target with 45 acp Winchester white box 230 grain Full Metal Jacket round nose now let's see what kind of penetration we get so how do we do the 45 ACP Full Metal Jacket well the bullet went through the ribs on the front didn't do a lot of damage to our first watermelon even though it has four pretty well centered hits did a lot more damage to the second watermelon this is where the bullets are starting to tumble all of the projectiles hit the ribs on the back penetrated them where a bullet hit a rib shattered it went through the leather jacket hide on the back and then they were all stopped by the first layer of fleece so it would appear that although 45 ACP hollow points are good and 10 millimeter hollow points even more so when it comes to getting complete penetration on what would represent a large animal plain old 45 acp 230 grain hard ball is hard to beat and it looks like it can also be pretty effective and there you have it and of course I could have gone on for days but I was trying to be concise so what are the real takeaways from this well first is the 10 millimeter powerful yes is it more powerful than a 45 yes is it more powerful than a locomotive been able to leap the tallest buildings in a single bound no and that power comes at a price in several ways first literally these two boxes of ammunition purchased at the same store on the same day the 45 was $19.75 the 10 millimeter was 22 75 $3 more that won't break the bank but these two boxes of ammunition again purchased at the same or on the same day the 45 was $27 the 10-millimeter was $37 that's a big difference there's also a price difference in the guns very commonly you go to a gun store and you see two pistols of similar make and model one to 10 millimeter 1 to 45 the 10 millimeter is more expensive there's also the matter of availability it's very common to go to a gun store and they'll have a pretty good selection of 45s and they won't have any 10 millimeters and that goes with the ammo as well I can go to buy Mart Walmart whatever and find 45 ammo any day of the week 10 millimeter not so much and it's not rare but it's just not as common as 45 and there aren't as many varieties of 10 millimeter as there are a 45 animal then there's the matter that although the 10 millimeter is more powerful there's some types of 45 ACP plus P and they're not all created equal but there are some 45 plus P rounds that really narrow that power gap but then those come with the downside of there's certain 45 pistols in which the + PM will just shouldn't be used so you've got pluses and minuses with both calibers there's also a social stigma attached to both of these and we talked about the 10 millimeter a little bit earlier if you have a 10 millimeter some people will assume you're a criminal and you'll also make all of those people that have 40 Smith & Wesson's reading envious of you but then if you have a 45 ACP people will assume you were born in 1911 t12 so again both calibers have the real pluses and minuses and the real bottom line is of course that no one can decide what's right for you except you and hopefully you'll do that with some good input and I would hope this was good input so as always don't try this at home on what you call a professional and thanks for watching the 10 millimeter versus 45 video
