#This repository includes all the code used for the Thesis 'Using entity-action-target relationships to classify conspiratorial youtube videos'.
#To summarize, the thesis used a conspiracy corpus, in this case conspiratorial reddit forums to extract relations between mentioned entities actions they perform and the target of the action. These triplets are then used to compare them to similar relations in youtube videos to determine if they are conspiratorial.

#The code is split into 11 scripts, originally Jupyter Notebooks, following the different steps of the pipeline, a short explanation of each script is given below.
#Additonally some of the resulting files from the code are uploaded as well and are also explained how they relate to the notebook and what they do. Intermediary results were not uploaded to avoid confusion regarding the amount of files.
